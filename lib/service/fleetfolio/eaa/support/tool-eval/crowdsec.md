**Tool Name:** [Crowdsec](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec)  
**Primary Function:** Community-driven Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) that analyzes logs/network traffic to block attacks and share threat intelligence.

### Recommendation:

☐ Yes, add it to EAA because it strengthens real-time defense and provides collaborative threat intelligence.

### Reasoning:

1. **Coverage:** Adds active blocking and detection of attacks (brute force, scans, SQLi, directory traversal) that VAPT tools don’t cover.
2. **Redundancy:** While other security tools may detect similar issues, Crowdsec’s collaborative intelligence makes it valuable for catching new/emerging threats.
3. **Integration Fit:** Outputs are structured and can be parsed into EAA pipelines.
4. **Proactive vs. Reactive:** Complements VAPT (proactive) by adding reactive defense during live attacks.
5. **Operational Value:** Benefits (real-time protection + shared intelligence) outweigh the minimal overhead of adding it.

### Summary:

Yes, Crowdsec should be added. It doesn’t replace VAPT, but it enhances our defensive stack with real-time protection and shared community intelligence, making it a strong complement to existing tools.
