**Tool Name:** [Promptfoo](https://www.promptfoo.dev/)

**Primary Function:** Open-source, developer-first framework for testing and securing large language models (LLMs) and AI agents through adaptive red teaming, vulnerability scanning, and compliance evaluations.

### Recommendation:

‚òê Yes, add it to EAA because it proactively identifies and mitigates LLM vulnerabilities, enhancing security and compliance in AI applications.

### Reasoning:

1. **Coverage:** Detects over 30 types of vulnerabilities, including prompt injections, jailbreaks, data leaks, and insecure tool use, which are often missed by traditional security tools. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
2. **Redundancy:** Complements existing security measures by providing dynamic, context-specific attack simulations, rather than relying on static or generic tests. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
3. **Integration Fit:** Seamlessly integrates into CI/CD pipelines and supports local-first deployment, enabling continuous security testing without external dependencies. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
4. **Proactive vs. Reactive:** Focuses on proactive security by identifying vulnerabilities during development, preventing potential exploits before deployment. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
5. **Operational Value:** Offers a developer-friendly CLI and web interface, facilitating rapid testing and remediation, thereby accelerating secure AI development. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Summary:

Yes, Promptfoo should be added. It doesn't replace traditional security tools but significantly enhances our AI security posture by providing tailored, proactive testing and continuous monitoring, making it a valuable addition to our security toolkit.
