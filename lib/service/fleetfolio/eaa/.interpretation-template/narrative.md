## Sections

### Introduction
- The Introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the Threat Exposure Management (TEM) program, emphasizing the criticality of proactively identifying, assessing, and mitigating threats across the enterprise ecosystem. It sets the context for why TEM is essential in safeguarding organizational assets, ensuring regulatory compliance, and maintaining operational resilience against an ever-evolving threat landscape. This section outlines the scope of TEM, the stakeholders involved, and the strategic alignment with the organization’s overall security posture.

### What is a TEM
- Threat Exposure Management (TEM) is a structured and dynamic approach to continuously identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential threats that could impact an organization’s information systems, applications, and operational processes. TEM encompasses the integration of threat intelligence, risk assessment, vulnerability management, and incident response to provide a holistic view of the organization’s exposure. Unlike traditional reactive security measures, TEM focuses on proactive detection and preemptive mitigation, enabling security teams to anticipate potential threats and reduce risk before exploitation occurs.

### Goals
- The primary goals of TEM are to minimize risk exposure, enhance organizational resilience, and ensure business continuity. Specific objectives include:
1. Proactive Threat Identification: Detect emerging threats before they impact systems or data.
2. Continuous Risk Assessment: Evaluate the likelihood and impact of threats across all assets.
3. Prioritized Mitigation: Allocate resources to address the highest-risk vulnerabilities effectively.
4. Operational Alignment: Ensure security initiatives align with business objectives and regulatory requirements.
5. Strategic Decision-Making: Provide actionable intelligence to leadership for informed risk management decisions.

### Attack Planning
- Attack Planning within a TEM perspective involves simulating potential adversary behaviors, understanding threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and designing scenarios to assess the organization’s preparedness. This section outlines the methodology for threat modeling, identifying critical assets, mapping attack surfaces, and defining potential threat vectors. It emphasizes the creation of controlled and repeatable testing plans to evaluate how current controls withstand simulated attacks, helping security teams refine detection, prevention, and response strategies.

### Methodologies
- TEM leverages a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies to ensure a thorough assessment of threat exposure. Key methodologies include:
1. Threat Intelligence Analysis: Gathering and analyzing global and industry-specific threat data to identify trends and potential risks.
2. Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing: Continuously identifying technical weaknesses in systems, applications, and networks.
3. Attack Surface Analysis: Mapping all external and internal exposure points to understand potential entry paths.
4. Red Teaming and Simulation Exercises: Emulating real-world attack scenarios to validate defenses and response capabilities.
5. Risk Scoring and Prioritization: Assigning risk levels based on asset value, threat likelihood, and potential impact to prioritize mitigation efforts.

### Responsibilities
- The Responsibilities section defines the roles and accountabilities required for effective TEM execution:
1. Security Operations Team: Conduct continuous monitoring, threat detection, and vulnerability management.
2. Risk Management and Compliance Teams: Ensure TEM activities align with regulatory obligations and organizational risk appetite.
3. Incident Response Team: Execute response and remediation plans during security events.
4. Leadership and Stakeholders: Provide strategic oversight, allocate resources, and enforce organizational security policies.
5. Business Units: Collaborate with TEM teams to identify critical assets and support risk mitigation initiatives.
