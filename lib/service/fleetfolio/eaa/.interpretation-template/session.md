## Title
- The Title section should always be derived directly from the scanning output results. Once a scan is performed, the results will typically enumerate one or more vulnerabilities identified within the target system or application. Each vulnerability discovered should then be explicitly reflected in the title field as a distinct heading. For example, if the scan output highlights a potential SQL Injection, the title should be framed as: “Possible SQL Injection in Login Page”. Similarly, if other vulnerabilities are found (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, Insecure Direct Object References, or Misconfigured Authentication), each of them should be represented as its own clearly defined and descriptive heading in this section. This ensures that the title provides immediate visibility into the nature and severity of the issue, allowing stakeholders to quickly understand the context without having to read through the full report.

## Reported By
**Tool Name**
- The Reported By field should explicitly state the tool, scanner, or method that was responsible for identifying the issue. This section provides important context regarding the origin of the finding and helps distinguish whether the vulnerability was detected through automated scanning tools, manual penetration testing, or a combination of both. For example, if the vulnerability was discovered using Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nmap, sqlmap, or any other specialized security testing tool, the name of that tool should be clearly mentioned here (e.g., “Reported By: Burp Suite Professional 2022v5.1”).

- Including the tool name ensures traceability of results, facilitates reproducibility of the test, and also provides insight into the detection capability of that particular scanner or methodology. In cases where multiple tools flagged the same issue, it is recommended to list all of them for completeness (e.g., “Identified by Burp Suite and validated manually”). If the issue was found through manual analysis, it should be clearly indicated as such (e.g., “Reported By: Manual Testing”) to differentiate from automated results.

- This level of detail not only strengthens the credibility of the finding but also helps teams prioritize verification and remediation efforts based on the reliability and scope of the tool or approach used to uncover the vulnerability.

## Description
- The Description section serves as the narrative core of the finding and should provide a clear, detailed, and comprehensive explanation of the identified issue. This is where the vulnerability is summarized in a way that is both technically accurate and easily understandable by different audiences, ranging from developers and system administrators to security managers and executive stakeholders.

- In this section, the vulnerability should be explained in plain terms, highlighting what was discovered, how it manifests, and why it matters. It should answer questions such as:
- What exactly is the vulnerability?
- Where was it identified (e.g., login page, API endpoint, configuration file)?
- How does the system behave when this vulnerability is triggered?
- What conditions or inputs led to its discovery?

- For example, if a SQL Injection was identified, the description should mention that the login form did not properly sanitize user input, allowing specially crafted queries (e.g., ' OR 1=1 --) to alter the logic of the database query. It should also highlight the system’s unexpected or abnormal behavior when the payload was submitted (e.g., returning generic error messages, bypassing login logic, or revealing database errors).

- The description should also provide contextual background on the issue — not just its technical nature, but also why it is concerning. This transforms the raw scan output into a meaningful story that can be understood without deep technical expertise. For example: “This vulnerability indicates insufficient input validation in the login form, which attackers could exploit to manipulate backend queries. If left unaddressed, this could expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access.”

- Ultimately, the Description is like the executive summary of the finding: concise enough to be readable, but detailed enough to capture the essence, impact, and seriousness of the vulnerability in a professional and authoritative manner.

## CVSS
- The CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) section is where the overall severity of the identified vulnerability is quantified using an industry-standard scoring framework. Unlike other sections that may be automatically populated by tools, the CVSS score in this report should be calculated manually to ensure accuracy, relevance, and contextual alignment with the specific environment in which the vulnerability was discovered.

- Automated scanners may provide their own severity ratings; however, those values are often generic and tool-specific, which means they may not fully reflect the actual risk to the organization. By manually calculating the CVSS score, the assessor ensures that the final rating takes into consideration real-world business impact, environmental factors, exploitability, and potential damage.

- When calculating the CVSS score, the assessor should carefully evaluate each of the Base Metrics (such as Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope, and Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). If applicable, Temporal Metrics (exploit code maturity, remediation level, report confidence) and Environmental Metrics (business criticality, modified impact, security requirements) should also be factored in to provide a more organization-specific risk assessment.

- For example, a SQL Injection vulnerability discovered in a public-facing authentication portal would likely be rated as Critical (CVSS 9.0–10.0) due to the potential for unauthorized access and full database compromise. In contrast, the same vulnerability in an internal, low-priority system might be rated lower after environmental considerations are applied.

- By stating explicitly that the CVSS score will be calculated manually, this section emphasizes that the process goes beyond automated defaults, providing a tailored, authoritative, and context-aware assessment of the vulnerability’s true severity. This ensures that remediation efforts can be properly prioritized in alignment with both technical risks and business objectives..

## Reproduction Steps
- The Reproduction Steps section is one of the most critical components of a vulnerability report because it provides a step-by-step, repeatable process that demonstrates how the issue was identified and how it can be verified by others. This section ensures that the finding is not just theoretical, but can be practically reproduced by developers, security engineers, or auditors who may later attempt to validate, triage, or remediate the issue.

- These steps should be documented with absolute clarity and precision, leaving no room for ambiguity. Each action taken by the tester—whether manual or automated—should be presented in a chronological, logical order, showing exactly how the vulnerability was discovered, exploited, or confirmed.

- Reproduction steps can be derived from both manual testing approaches and automated scanning methods:

1. Manual methods allow the assessor to simulate real-world attacker behavior, using crafted inputs, payloads, or interactions with the application to trigger the vulnerability. For example, manually entering ’ OR 1=1 -- into a login form field to test for SQL Injection.

2. Automated methods involve using specialized tools or scripts (e.g., Burp Suite, sqlmap, Nmap, OWASP ZAP) that can systematically scan the application and identify vulnerabilities more efficiently. These tools often provide detailed logs, requests, and responses that can be directly incorporated into the reproduction steps.

- For best practice, each step should include:

1. The exact action performed (e.g., navigate to a specific URL, submit a particular payload).

2. The expected behavior (what should have happened if the system was secure).

3. The actual observed behavior (what the system did instead, which revealed the vulnerability).

- For example:

1. Navigate to https://targetsite.com/login.

2. Enter `' OR 1=1 --` as the username and any random string as the password.

3. Click the Login button.

4. Observe that the application returns a generic error rather than the standard “Invalid credentials” message.

Note that the irregular response indicates potential unsanitized input being processed by the backend.

- By explicitly combining both manual exploration and automated scanning outputs, the Reproduction Steps section becomes a comprehensive, hybrid validation path—showing how the vulnerability was found, how it behaves, and how it can be reliably reproduced under controlled conditions. This thorough documentation not only strengthens the credibility of the finding but also accelerates remediation by allowing developers and security teams to retrace the tester’s exact path.

## Business Impact
- The Business Impact section is designed to articulate, in clear and business-oriented language, the potential consequences of the identified vulnerability if it were to be successfully exploited. Unlike the technical description or reproduction steps, which focus on the “how”, this section focuses on the “so what”—that is, why this vulnerability matters to the organization.

- This part should translate technical findings into real-world risks that executives, managers, and non-technical stakeholders can immediately understand. For instance, rather than simply stating “SQL Injection allows attackers to manipulate queries,” the business impact should highlight the damage this manipulation could cause: unauthorized access to sensitive customer data, financial fraud, reputational damage, regulatory non-compliance, or even complete system compromise.

- Although some automated tools attempt to generate preliminary business impact statements, these outputs often remain generic and context-agnostic. A well-written report should expand upon automated results by considering the organization’s environment, data sensitivity, and regulatory obligations. For example, the same SQL Injection vulnerability could have vastly different impacts in a healthcare system (HIPAA violations, patient data breaches) compared to a retail e-commerce platform (loss of customer trust, PCI-DSS non-compliance).

- Thus, while the initial draft of the Business Impact may be automated, it is essential to refine it manually with contextual awareness, ensuring it accurately reflects the true organizational risk profile.


## Recommendations
- The Recommendations section provides clear, actionable, and prioritized guidance on how to remediate or mitigate the identified vulnerability. It acts as the bridge between detection and resolution, ensuring that technical teams have concrete steps to follow in order to close the security gap.

- Automated scanners are often capable of suggesting basic remediation techniques—for example, recommending “use parameterized queries” for SQL Injection, or “escape user input” for Cross-Site Scripting. These automated suggestions are valuable starting points, but they usually lack the depth, specificity, and contextual tailoring required for effective remediation in a given environment.

- A strong recommendation should:

1. Address the root cause rather than just the symptoms (e.g., fixing insecure query construction, not just filtering inputs).

2. Provide implementation guidance that is specific to the technology stack in use (e.g., “Use prepared statements in PHP PDO” instead of just “sanitize inputs”).

3. Include references to best practices, industry standards, or vendor documentation (e.g., OWASP guidelines, NIST recommendations).

4. Offer both short-term mitigations and long-term solutions, enabling teams to protect systems immediately while planning for permanent fixes.

- While automated recommendations can be used as the foundation of this section, it is strongly advised to supplement them with manual analysis to ensure accuracy, completeness, and relevance to the organization’s unique environment. This hybrid approach ensures that remediation advice is not only technically correct but also practical, implementable, and aligned with organizational priorities.
