# Dashboard

## General Information
- **User:**  
  Insert the primary analyst, consultant, or team responsible for preparing this dashboard. Include the role (e.g., Lead Pentester, Security Analyst, Engagement Manager) and, if relevant, supporting team members.  

- **Time Period:**  
  Clearly state the timeframe covered by this dashboard (e.g., *Q1 2025*, *Jan–Mar 2025*, or *01 March 2025 – 15 April 2025*). This ensures that findings are interpreted in the correct temporal context.  

- **Client(s):**  
  List the client(s) for whom this dashboard was prepared. If multiple clients are covered, explicitly separate by engagement scope. Provide identifiers such as business unit names, subsidiary organizations, or project names.

## Findings Overview
- **Total Open/In Process Findings:**  
  The total number of findings that remain unresolved or are actively being worked on. Reflects the current workload and outstanding risk exposure.  

- **Total Findings Closed:**  
  Number of findings successfully remediated and validated. This highlights the progress of mitigation efforts.  

- **Percentage of Findings Closed:**  
  A ratio (closed ÷ total findings) × 100%. This metric measures overall remediation efficiency and can be tracked across reporting cycles for improvement trends.

## Findings by Severity

### Critical Findings
- **Total Critical Findings:**  
  Count of all findings with immediate, high business impact (e.g., remote code execution, full privilege escalation, crown-jewel data compromise).  
- **Percentage of Critical Findings Closed:**  
  Shows remediation focus on the most dangerous issues. Organizations often benchmark this at 100% closure before project wrap-up.  
- **Details:**  
  - **Date Opened:** When the critical finding was first discovered.  
  - **Date Closed (if applicable):** When remediation and retesting confirmed successful closure.  
  - **Actions Taken:** Explicit corrective measures (e.g., “Deployed emergency patch for CVE-2025-XXXX,” “Disabled vulnerable VPN service,” “Implemented network segmentation”).  

---

### High Findings
- **Total High Findings:**  
  Count of severe but not business-critical issues (e.g., privilege escalation without direct external access, authentication bypass in non-core apps).  
- **Percentage of High Findings Closed:**  
  Indicates how effectively severe threats are being reduced.  
- **Details:**  
  - **Date Opened:** Discovery timestamp.  
  - **Date Closed:** If closed, document remediation timeline.  
  - **Actions Taken:** Describe technical/administrative controls applied (e.g., “Restricted administrative accounts,” “Updated WAF rules,” “Forced password resets”).  

---

### Medium Findings
- **Total Medium Findings:**  
  Issues with moderate business impact, such as insecure configurations or exposure requiring chained exploitation.  
- **Percentage of Medium Findings Closed:**  
  Closure rate demonstrates progress on long-term hygiene improvements.  
- **Details:**  
  - **Date Opened:** Discovery date.  
  - **Date Closed:** If fixed, include closure date.  
  - **Actions Taken:** E.g., “Hardened TLS configurations,” “Implemented account lockout after failed attempts,” “Limited SMB share permissions.”  

---

### Low Findings
- **Total Low Findings:**  
  Findings with minimal immediate impact but still requiring correction to improve posture.  
- **Percentage of Low Findings Closed:**  
  Reflects the organization’s commitment to closing even low-priority gaps.  
- **Details:**  
  - **Date Opened:** When finding was logged.  
  - **Date Closed:** Closure date, if applicable.  
  - **Actions Taken:** E.g., “Updated internal documentation,” “Disabled unnecessary banner information,” “Applied security headers.”  

---

### Informational Findings
- **Total Informational Findings:**  
  Non-critical observations intended for awareness, best practices, or future improvement.  
- **Percentage of Informational Findings Closed:**  
  These are often recommendations rather than mandatory fixes, but closure can show process maturity.  
- **Details:**  
  - **Date Opened:** Noted in the report.  
  - **Date Closed:** Closure not always applicable, but can reflect optional implementation.  
  - **Actions Taken:** E.g., “Enhanced employee awareness materials,” “Documented backup policy,” “Upgraded internal audit procedures.”  

---

## Trends & Analysis
- **Findings by Severity over Time:**  
  Provide both numerical and narrative insights. Example:  
  - Critical findings are trending downward due to prioritized remediation.  
  - High and medium findings remain steady, indicating consistent risk levels.  
  - A noticeable increase in low findings reflects maturing assessment thoroughness.  
  - Compare quarterly or monthly changes, highlight “spikes” linked to specific campaigns, or note any regression due to patch rollbacks or misconfigurations.  

---

## Actions & Notes
- **Summary of Actions Taken:**  
  Summarize major remediation milestones: patches deployed, configuration hardening, policy enforcement, employee training, blue team improvements.  

- **Pending Actions:**  
  Explicitly list next steps (e.g., “Re-test SAML authentication bypass fix,” “Deploy EDR agent to remaining 20% endpoints,” “Finalize segmentation of finance servers”).  

- **Additional Notes:**  
  Capture contextual information such as:  
  - Known delays (vendor patch pending, business unit approval required).  
  - Client constraints (legacy system dependencies, compliance freeze periods).  
  - Positive notes (Blue Team improved phishing detection rate, SOC response time reduced by 30%).

## Critical Findings Summary
- **Overview of Critical Findings:**  
  Provide a high-level yet expressive summary that prioritizes urgency. Example:  

  “During this reporting period, critical findings exposed direct risks to %%CLIENT_NAME%%’s core operations. These included external-facing systems vulnerable to authentication bypass, misconfigured access controls allowing sensitive data leakage, and delayed patching of high-profile CVEs. Immediate remediation has been partially completed, with full closure pending validation. The persistence of these findings poses substantial risk to business continuity, regulatory compliance, and brand reputation. Failure to resolve them in a timely manner could enable real-world adversaries to achieve complete environment compromise.”
