# Report Findings

## Overview
The **Overview** section provides a high-level summary of the security assessment or exercise, serving as a concise yet comprehensive snapshot of the evaluation’s purpose, scope, and critical metadata. This section is designed to immediately inform stakeholders about the context and significance of the findings. It includes:  

- **Report Title:** Clearly identifies the formal name of the report, reflecting the type of assessment, organizational focus, or exercise conducted, ensuring it can be referenced in future audits or governance reviews.  
- **Exercise Name:** Specifies the particular security assessment, penetration test, or threat exposure exercise performed, providing traceability and context for the findings.  
- **Date:** Captures the date when the assessment was completed or the report generated, ensuring chronological clarity for tracking remediation timelines and SLA compliance.  
- **Total Findings:** Presents a numeric summary of all identified issues, offering a quick indication of the organization’s current exposure and risk landscape.  


## Findings List
The **Findings List** constitutes the core of the report, detailing each identified issue with precision and clarity. This table is designed for actionable insight, allowing teams to prioritize, assign, and track remediation efforts efficiently. Each entry should provide complete contextual information to facilitate understanding and resolution:  

### | Severity  | Finding Title                                                | Assigned To            | Start Date  | Time to SLA |  Status    | Risk Score   |

- Severity:       LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL
- Finding Title:  A descriptive and clear title of the identified finding, capturing the essence of the vulnerability or risk observed.
- Assigned To:    The team member or group responsible for addressing the finding, ensuring accountability and tracking.
- Start Date:     DATE
- Time to SLA:    Estimated or defined timeframe for remediation according to SLA, helping track response efficiency.
- Status:         Current progress or workflow status of the finding, such as In Process, Open, Closed, or Resolved, indicating operational oversight.
- Risk Score:     Quantitative or qualitative risk score representing the potential impact and likelihood, aiding in prioritization and management.


This table allows the report to act not just as documentation but as a **dynamic operational tool**, guiding remediation and facilitating oversight by stakeholders and leadership.  


## Filters
The **Filters** section provides clarity on how findings can be categorized, prioritized, and segmented for deeper analysis. It allows security teams and management to focus on specific risk areas, track performance against SLAs, and make data-driven decisions:  

- **Severity Levels:** Categorizes findings by potential impact and urgency.  
  - **Critical:** Immediate attention required; could result in catastrophic impact on operations, data integrity, or compliance.  
  - **High:** Significant risk with potential operational or financial consequences if left unaddressed.  
  - **Medium:** Moderate impact; remediation recommended within standard SLAs.  
  - **Low:** Minor issues with limited impact, often related to best practice or policy compliance.  
- **Status Options:** Tracks the lifecycle of each finding to ensure visibility and accountability.  
  - **In Process:** Active remediation is underway, but not yet completed.  
  - **Open:** Finding identified and acknowledged, pending action.  
  - **Closed:** Finding has been addressed, but may require verification or follow-up.  
  - **Resolved:** Remediation completed and verified; risk no longer exists.

## Additional Notes
The **Additional Notes** section provides space for supplementary information, observations, or contextual insights that do not fit within the structured tables but are essential for understanding the broader threat landscape or operational impact. This may include:  

- Observations about recurring patterns or systemic weaknesses.  
- Contextual information about testing methodology or environmental factors.  
- Recommendations or strategic insights that inform future TEM initiatives.  

By integrating this section, the report ensures a **holistic understanding** of the security posture, beyond individual findings, capturing nuances and intelligence that support continuous improvement and proactive threat management.
