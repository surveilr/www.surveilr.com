### Overview
This test case group is structured to ensure the seamless functionality and reliability of Surveilr by validating key integration points and performance metrics:
- **Data Ingestion**: Verifying Surveilr's capability to handle multiple data formats (JSON, CSV, XML) without errors or data loss.
- **Data Processing Integrity**: Ensuring that all ingested data is accurately processed and retains integrity throughout.
- **Reporting Accuracy**: Validating that generated reports reflect the processed data accurately and meet compliance requirements.
- **Performance Under Load**: Testing the system's ability to handle concurrent ingestion requests and maintain performance benchmarks.
- **Automated Testing**: Facilitating integration into CI/CD pipelines for consistent testing and validation of new releases.
