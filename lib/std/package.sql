This document provides an organized and comprehensive overview of ``surveilr``''''s RSSD migration process starting from ``v 1.0.0``, breaking down each component and the steps followed to ensure smooth and efficient migrations. It covers the creation of key tables and views, the handling of migration cells, and the sequence for executing migration scripts.

---

## Session and State Initialization

To manage temporary session data and track user state, we use the ``session_state_ephemeral`` table, which stores essential session information like the current user. This table is temporary, meaning it only persists data for the duration of the session, and it''''s especially useful for identifying the user responsible for specific actions during the migration.

Each time the migration process runs, we initialize session data in this table, ensuring all necessary information is available without affecting the core database tables. This initialization prepares the system for more advanced operations that rely on knowing the user executing each action.

---

## Assurance Schema Table

The ``assurance_schema`` table is designed to store various schema-related details, including the type of schema assurance, associated codes, and related governance data. This table is central to defining the structure of assurance records, which are useful for validating data, tracking governance requirements, and recording creation timestamps. All updates to the schema are logged to track when they were last modified and by whom.

---

## Code Notebook Kernel, Cell, and State Tables

``surveilr`` uses a structured system of code notebooks to store and execute SQL commands. These commands, or “cells,” are grouped into notebooks, and each notebook is associated with a kernel, which provides metadata about the notebook''''s language and structure. The main tables involved here are:

- **``code_notebook_kernel``**: Stores information about different kernels, each representing a unique execution environment or language.
- **``code_notebook_cell``**: Holds individual code cells within each notebook, along with their associated metadata and execution history.
- **``code_notebook_state``**: Tracks each cell''''s state changes, such as when it was last executed and any errors encountered.

By organizing migration scripts into cells and notebooks, ``surveilr`` can maintain detailed control over execution order and track the state of each cell individually. This tracking is essential for handling updates, as it allows us to execute migrations only when necessary.

---

## Views for Managing Cell Versions and Migrations

Several views are defined to simplify and organize the migration process by managing different versions of code cells and identifying migration candidates. These views help filter, sort, and retrieve the cells that need execution.

### Key Views

- **``code_notebook_cell_versions``**: Lists all available versions of each cell, allowing the migration tool to retrieve older versions if needed for rollback or auditing.
- **``code_notebook_cell_latest``**: Shows only the latest version of each cell, simplifying the migration by focusing on the most recent updates.
- **``code_notebook_sql_cell_migratable``**: Filters cells to include only those that are eligible for migration, ensuring that non-executable cells are ignored.

---

## Migration-Oriented Views and Dynamic Migration Scripts

To streamline the migration process, several migration-oriented views organize the data by listing cells that require execution or are ready for re-execution. By grouping these cells in specific views, ``surveilr`` dynamically generates a script that executes only the necessary cells.

### Key Views

- **``code_notebook_sql_cell_migratable_not_executed``**: Lists migratable cells that haven’t yet been executed.
- **``code_notebook_sql_cell_migratable_state``**: Shows the latest migratable cells, along with their current state transitions.

---

## How Migrations Are Executed

When it''''s time to apply changes to the database, this section explains the process in detail, focusing on how ``surveilr`` prepares the environment, identifies which cells to migrate, executes the appropriate SQL code, and ensures data integrity throughout.

---

### 1. Initialization

The first step in the migration process involves setting up the essential database tables and seeding initial values. This lays the foundation for the migration process, making sure that all tables, views, and temporary values needed are in place.

- **Check for Core Tables**: ``surveilr`` first verifies whether the required tables, such as ``code_notebook_cell``, ``code_notebook_state``, and others starting with ``code_notebook%``, are already set up in the database.
- **Setup**: If these tables do not yet exist, ``surveilr`` automatically initiates the setup by running the initial SQL script, known as ``bootstrap.sql``. This script contains SQL commands that create all the essential tables and views discussed in previous sections.
- **Seeding**: During the execution of ``bootstrap.sql``, essential data, such as temporary values in the ``session_state_ephemeral`` table (e.g., information about the current user), is also added to ensure that the migration session has the data it needs to proceed smoothly.

---

### 2. Migration Preparation and Identification of Cells to Execute

Once the environment is ready, ``surveilr`` examines which specific cells (code blocks in the migration notebook) need to be executed to bring the database up to the latest version.

- **Listing Eligible Cells**: ``surveilr`` begins by consulting views such as ``code_notebook_sql_cell_migratable_not_executed``. This view is a pre-filtered list of cells that are eligible for migration but haven’t yet been executed.
- **Idempotent vs. Non-Idempotent Cells**: ``surveilr`` then checks whether each cell is marked as “idempotent” or “non-idempotent.”
   - **Idempotent Cells** can be executed multiple times without adverse effects. If they have been run before, they can safely be run again without impacting data integrity.
   - **Non-Idempotent Cells**, identified by names containing ``_once_``, should only be executed once. If these cells have been executed previously, they are skipped in the migration process to prevent unintentional re-runs.

---

### 3. Dynamic Script Generation and Execution

``surveilr`` then assembles a custom SQL script that includes only the cells identified as eligible for execution. This script is crafted carefully to ensure each cell''''s SQL code is executed in the correct order and with the right contextual information.

- **Script Creation**: We start by generating a dynamic script in a single transaction block. Transactions are a way of grouping a series of commands so that they are either all applied or none are, which protects data integrity.
- **Inclusion of Cells Based on Eligibility**:
   - For each cell, ``surveilr`` checks its eligibility status. If it''''s non-idempotent and already executed, it''''s marked with a comment noting that it''''s excluded from the script due to previous execution.
   - If the cell is idempotent or eligible for re-execution, its SQL code is added to the script, along with additional details such as comments about the cell''''s last execution date.
- **State Transition Records**: After each cell''''s SQL code, additional commands are added to record the cell''''s transition state. This step inserts information into ``code_notebook_state``, logging details such as the cell ID, transition state (from “Pending” to “Executed”), and the reason for the transition (“Migration” or “Reapplication”). These logs are invaluable for auditing purposes.

---

### 4. Execution in a Transactional Block

With the script prepared, ``surveilr`` then executes the entire batch of SQL commands within a transactional block.

- **BEGIN TRANSACTION**: The script begins with a transaction, ensuring that all changes are applied as a single, atomic unit.
- **Running Cell Code**: Within this transaction, each cell''''s SQL code is executed in the order it appears in the script.
- **Error Handling**: If any step in the transaction fails, all changes are rolled back. This prevents partial updates from occurring, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state.
- **COMMIT**: If the script executes successfully without errors, the transaction is committed, finalizing the changes. The ``COMMIT`` command signifies the end of the migration session, making all updates permanent.

---

### 5. Finalizing Migration and Recording Results

After a successful migration session, ``surveilr`` concludes by recording details about the migration process.

- **Final Updates to ``code_notebook_state``**: Any cells marked as “Executed” are updated in ``code_notebook_state`` with the latest timestamp, indicating their successful migration.
- **Logging Completion**: Activity logs are updated with relevant details, ensuring a clear record of the migration.
- **Cleanup of Temporary Data**: Finally, temporary data is cleared, such as entries in ``session_state_ephemeral``, since these values were only needed during the migration process.

### 🆕 **New Features**
- **osQuery Management Server Integration**:  
  - `surveilr` now acts as a management layer for osQuery, enabling secure and efficient monitoring of infrastructure.
  - Supports remote configuration, logging, and query execution for osQuery nodes.

- **Behavior & Notebooks Support**:  
  - Introduced **Notebooks**, which store predefined queries in the `code_notebook_cell` table.
  - **Behaviors** allow defining and managing query execution for different node groups.

- **Secure Node Enrollment**:  
  - Nodes authenticate using an **enrollment secret key** (`SURVEILR_OSQUERY_MS_ENROLL_SECRET`).
  - Secure communication via **TLS certificates** (`cert.pem`, `key.pem`).

- **Automated Query Execution**:  
  - Default queries from **"osQuery Management Server (Prime)"** execute automatically.
  - Custom notebooks and queries can be added dynamically via SQL.

- **Centralized Logging & Config Fetching**:  
  - Osquery logs and configurations are fetched via TLS endpoints (`/logger`, `/config`).
  - All communication is secured using **server-side TLS certificates**.

- **Web UI for Query Results Visualization**:  
  - `surveilr web-ui` provides an intuitive dashboard to inspect query results across enrolled nodes.

## 🚀 What''''s New

### 1. Enhancing `surveilr`''''s osQuery Management Server
- Introduced a new flag--behavior` or `-b` to specify behavior name to queries to run automatically enrolled nodes.
- a new SQLite function called `surveilr_osquery_ms_create_behaviour` to facilitate the creation of behaviors, making process smooth and easy.

### Example
When starting the `surveilr osquery-ms` server without passing a behavior, a default behavior with the following query configuration is created:
```json
{
  "surveilr-cli": {
    ...
    "osquery_ms": {
      "tls_proc": {
 "query": "select * from processes",
        "interval": 60
      }
    }
  }
}
```
To use a behavior with the `surveilr` osQuery management server first create a behavior using the new function: 
```bash
surveilr shell --cmd "select surveil_osquery_ms_create_behaviour(''''-behaviour'''', ''''{\"tls_proc\": {\"query\": \"select * from processes\", \"interval\": 60}, \"routes\": {\"query\": \"SELECT * FROM routes WHERE destination = ''''''''::1''''''''\", \"interval\": 60}}'''');"
```
Then, pass that behavior to the server by:

```bash
surveilr osquery-ms --cert ./cert.pem --key ./key.pem --enroll-secret "<secret>" -b "initial-behaviour"
```'' as description_md;
                

                    SELECT ''foldable'' as component;
                    SELECT ''v1.7.0'' as title, ''# `surveilr` v1.7.0 Release Notes

## 🚀 What''''s New

### 1. **Open Project Data Extension**
`surveilr` now includes additional data from Open Project PLM ingestion. Details such as a work package''''s versions and relations are now encapsulated in JSON format in a new `elaboration` column within the `ur_ingest_session_plm_acct_project_issue` table. The JSON structure is as follows, with the possibility for extension:
```json
elaboration: {"issue_id": 78829, "relations": [...], "version": {...}}
```

### 2. **Functions for Extension Verification**
Two new functions have been introduced to verify and ensure the presence of certain intended functions and extensions before their use:
- The `select surveilr_ensure_function(''''func'''', ''''if not found msg'''', ''''func2'''', ''''if func2 not found msg'''')` function can be used to declaratively specify the required function(s), and will produce an error with guidance on how to obtain the function if it is not found.

- The `select surveilr_ensure_extension(''''extn.so'''', ''''../bin/extn2.so'''')` function allows for the declarative indication of necessary extensions, and will dynamically load them if they are not already available.'' as description_md;

## 🚀 What''''s New

### 1. Utilizing Custom Extensions with `surveilr`
In the previous release, we introduced the feature of automatically loading extensions from the default `sqlpkg` location. However, this posed a security risk, and we have since disabled that feature. To use extensions installed by `sqlpkg`, simply pass `--sqlpkg`, and the default location will be utilized. If you wish to change the directory from which extensions are loaded, use `--sqlpkg /path/to/extensions`, or specify the directory with the new `SURVEILR_SQLPKG` environment variable.'' as description_md;
                

                    SELECT ''foldable'' as component;
                    SELECT ''v1.4.2'' as title, ''# `surveilr` v1.4.2 Release Notes 🎉

---

## 🚀 What''''s New

### 1. Utilizing Custom Extensions with **`surveilr`**
Loading extensions is now straightforward with the `--sqlite-dyn-extn` flag. As long as your extensions are installed via [`sqlpkg`](https://sqlpkg.org/), `surveilr` will automatically detect the default location of `sqlpkg` and all installed extensions. Simply install the extension using `sqlpkg`. To specify a custom path for `sqlpkg`, use the `--sql-pkg-home` argument with a directory containing the extensions, regardless of depth, and `surveilr` will locate them. Additionally, the `SURVEILR_SQLITE_DYN_EXTNS` environment variable has been introduced to designate an extension path instead of using `--sqlite-dyn-extn`.
**Note**: Using `--sqlite-dyn-extn` won''''t prevent `surveilr` from loading extensions from `sqlpkg`''''s default directory. To disable loading from `sqlpkg`, use the `--no-sqlpkg` flag.

Here''''s a detailed example of using `surveilr shell` and `surveilr orchestrate` with dynamic extensions.
**Using `sqlpkg` defaults**
- Download the [`sqlpkg` CLI](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlpkg-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#download-and-install-preferred-method).
- Download the [text extension](https://sqlpkg.org/?q=text), which offers various text manipulation functions: `sqlpkg install nalgeon/sqlean`
- Run the following command:
  ```bash
  surveilr shell --cmd "select text_substring(''''hello world'''', 7, 5) AS result" # surveilr loads all extensions from the .sqlpkg default directory
  ```

**Including an additional extension with `sqlpkg`**
Combine `--sqlite-dyn-extn` with `surveilr`''''s ability to load extensions from `sqlpkg`
- Add the `path` extension to `sqlpkg`''''s installed extensions: `sqlpkg install asg017/path`
- Execute:
  ```bash
  surveilr shell --cmd "SELECT
        text_substring(''''hello world'''', 7, 5) AS substring_result,
        math_sqrt(9) AS sqrt_result,
        path_parts.type,
        path_parts.part 
    FROM 
        (SELECT * FROM path_parts(''''/usr/bin/sqlite3'''')) AS path_parts;
    " --sqlite-dyn-extn .extensions/math.so
  ```

**Specify a Custom Directory to Load Extensions From**
A `--sqlpkg-home` flag has been introduced to specify a custom path for extensions. They do not need to be installed by `sqlpkg` to be used. `surveilr` will navigate the specified folder and load all compatible extensions for the operating system—`.so` for Linux, `.dll` for Windows, and `.dylib` for macOS. (If you installed with `sqlpkg`, you don''''t need to know the file type).
```bash
surveilr shell --cmd "SELECT text_substring(''''hello world'''', 7, 5) AS substring_result, math_sqrt(9) AS sqrt_result" --sqlpkg-home ./src/resource_serde/src/functions/extensions/
```

### 2. Upgraded SQLPage
SQLPage has been updated to version 0.31.0, aligning with the latest releases.'' as description_md;

## 🚀 Bug Fixes

### 1. **`surveilr` SQLite Extensions**
To temporarily mitigate the issue with `surveilr` intermittently working due to the dynamic loading of extensions, `surveilr` no longer supports dynamic loading by default. It is now supported only upon request by using the `--sqlite-dyn-extn` flag. This flag is a multiple option that specifies the path to an extension to be loaded into `surveilr`. To obtain the dynamic versions (`.dll`, `.so`, or `.dylib`), you can use [`sqlpkg`](https://sqlpkg.org/) to install the necessary extension.

For instance, to utilize the `text` functions:
- Install the extension with [`sqlpkg`](https://sqlpkg.org/?q=text): `sqlpkg install nalgeon/text`
- Then execute it:
  ```bash
  surveilr shell --cmd "select text_substring(''''hello world'''', 7, 5);" --sqlite-dyn-extn ./text.so
  ```'' as description_md;

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. **Integrated Documentation in Web UI**

This release introduces a comprehensive update to the RSSD Web UI, allowing users to access and view all `surveilr`-related SQLite functions, release notes, and internal documentation directly within the interface. This feature enhances user experience by providing integrated, easily navigable documentation without the need to leave the web environment, ensuring that all necessary information is readily available for efficient reference and usage.

### 2. **`uniform_resource` Graph Infrastructure**

The foundational framework for tracking `uniform_resource` content using graph representations has been laid out in this release. This infrastructure allows users to visualize `uniform_resource` data as connected graphs in addition to the traditional relational database structure. To facilitate this, three dedicated views—`imap_graph`, `plm_graph`, and `filesystem_graph`—have been created. These views provide a structured way to observe and interact with data from different ingestion sources:

- **`imap_graph`**: Represents the graphical relationships for content ingested through IMAP processes, allowing for a visual mapping of email and folder structures.
- **`plm_graph`**: Visualizes content from PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) ingestion, showcasing project and issue-based connections.
- **`filesystem_graph`**: Illustrates file ingestion paths and hierarchies, enabling users to track and manage file-based data more intuitively.

This release marks an important step towards enhancing data tracking capabilities, providing a dual approach of relational and graphical views for better data insights and management.

---

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. **Database Migration System**

This release introduces a comprehensive database migration feature that allows smooth and controlled updates to the RSSD structure. Our migration system includes:

- **Structured Notebooks and Cells**: A structured system organizes SQL migration scripts into modular code notebooks, making migration scripts easy to track, audit, and execute as needed.
- **Idempotent vs. Non-Idempotent Handling**: Ensures each migration runs in an optimal and secure manner by tracking cell execution history, allowing for re-execution where safe.
- **Automated State Tracking**: All state changes are logged for complete auditing, showing timestamps, transition details, and the results of each migration step.
- **Transactional Execution**: All migrations run within a single transaction block for seamless rollbacks and data consistency.
- **Dynamic Migration Scripts**: Cells marked for migration are dynamically added to the migration script, reducing manual effort and risk of errors.

This system ensures safe, controlled migration of database changes, enhancing reliability and traceability for every update.

### 2. **Enhanced Default Command and Web UI Launch**

The surveilr executable now starts the Web UI as the default command when no specific CLI commands are passed. This feature aims to enhance accessibility and ease of use for new users and teams. Here’s what happens by default:

- **Automatic Web UI Startup**: By default, running surveilr without additional commands launches the surveilr Web UI.
- **Auto-Browser Launch**: Opens the default browser on the workstation, pointing to the Web UI’s URL and port, providing a user-friendly experience right from the first run.'' as description_md;
