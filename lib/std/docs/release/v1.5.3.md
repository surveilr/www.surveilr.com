# `surveilr` v1.5.3 Release Notes ðŸŽ‰

---

## ðŸš€ What's New

### 1. **Open Project Data Extension**
`surveilr` now includes additional data from Open Project PLM ingestion. Details such as a work package's versions and relations are now encapsulated in JSON format in a new `elaboration` column within the `ur_ingest_session_plm_acct_project_issue` table. The JSON structure is as follows, with the possibility for extension:
```json
elaboration: {"issue_id": 78829, "relations": [...], "version": {...}}
```

### 2. **Functions for Extension Verification**
Two new functions have been introduced to verify and ensure the presence of certain intended functions and extensions before their use:
- The `select surveilr_ensure_function('func', 'if not found msg', 'func2', 'if func2 not found msg')` function can be used to declaratively specify the required function(s), and will produce an error with guidance on how to obtain the function if it is not found.

- The `select surveilr_ensure_extension('extn.so', '../bin/extn2.so')` function allows for the declarative indication of necessary extensions, and will dynamically load them if they are not already available.
