---

## ðŸš€ What's New

### 1. **Open Project Data Extension**
`surveilr` now includes additional data from Open Project PLM ingestion. Details such as a work package's versions and relations are now encapsulated in JSON format in a new `elaboration` column within the `ur_ingest_session_plm_acct_project_issue` table. The JSON structure is as follows, with the possibility for extension:
```json
elaboration: {"issue_id": 78829, "relations": [...], "version": {...}}
```
