# `surveilr` v1.4.2 Release Notes ðŸŽ‰

---

## ðŸš€ What's New

### 1. Utilizing Custom Extensions with `surveilr`
In the previous release, we introduced the feature of automatically loading extensions from the default `sqlpkg` location. However, this posed a security risk, and we have since disabled that feature. To use extensions installed by `sqlpkg`, simply pass `--sqlpkg`, and the default location will be utilized. If you wish to change the directory from which extensions are loaded, use `--sqlpkg /path/to/extensions`, or specify the directory with the new `SURVEILR_SQLPKG` environment variable.
