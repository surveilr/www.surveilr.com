# `surveilr` v1.8.0 Release Notes

---

## ðŸš€ What's New

### **1. SQLPage**
- Updated SQLPage to the latest version, `v0.34.0`, ensuring compatibility and access to the newest features and bug fixes.

### 2. Introduced `surveilr_notebook_cell_exec`
`surveilr_notebook_cell_exec` is a function designed to execute queries stored in `code_notebook_cell`s against the RSSD. This is the SQLite function equivalent of the `surveilr notebook cat` command which only outputs the content of the `code_notebook_cell`, this function on other hand, executes it. It takes two arguments, the `notebook_name` and the `cell_name` and it returns either `true` or `false` to denote if the execution was succesful.

## Bug Fixes
1. Fixed the SQL query issue when `--persist-raw-logs` is passed to the `surveilr osquery-ms` server.
