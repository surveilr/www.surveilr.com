# `surveilr ` v2.2.0 Release Notes

## ðŸš€ What's New

1. JSONL File Ingestion Support

- New Format Support: Added comprehensive JSONL (JSON Lines) file format ingestion capabilities
- Streaming Data Processing: Efficiently handles large streaming JSON datasets line-by-line
- Automatic Schema Detection: Intelligently detects and processes JSONL file structures

## How JSONL Ingestion Works

Unlike regular JSON files that contain a single JSON object or array, JSONL files contain one valid JSON object per
line:

{"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "timestamp": "2025-09-01T10:00:00Z"}
{"id": 2, "name": "Bob", "timestamp": "2025-09-01T10:01:00Z"}
{"id": 3, "name": "Charlie", "timestamp": "2025-09-01T10:02:00Z"}

Ingestion Process:
1. Line-by-Line Reading: File is read sequentially, one line at a time
2. JSON Validation: Each line is validated as proper JSON
3. Individual Processing: Each JSON object is processed as a separate resource
4. Schema Evolution: Supports varying schemas across lines in the same file
6. Line-Specific URIs: Each line gets a unique URI with line number reference for precise tracking

### URI Structure for JSONL:
Each JSON line creates a unique uniform_resource entry with line-specific URI:
/path/to/events.jsonl#L1    # First JSON object
/path/to/events.jsonl#L2    # Second JSON object
/path/to/events.jsonl#L3    # Third JSON object

### Example:
File: /data/user-events.jsonl
Line 1: {"user": "alice", "action": "login", "timestamp": "2025-09-01T10:00:00Z"}
Line 2: {"user": "bob", "action": "logout", "timestamp": "2025-09-01T10:05:00Z"}

### Results in uniform_resource entries with URIs:
/data/user-events.jsonl#L1
/data/user-events.jsonl#L2

This unique URI scheme allows precise tracking of which specific line in the JSONL file each resource originated
from, enabling accurate data lineage and debugging capabilities.
