# `surveilr` v1.7.16 Release Notes

## Bug Fixes
1. Enhanced the CSV transform functionality to correctly include partyID for each ingested CSV table when provided.

2. Resolved an issue where ingesting multiple CSV files with the same name from different folders resulted in data loss. Now, all files are consolidated into a single table while preserving distinct data sources with the partyID field.
