   * Does copy integrate keywords naturally without **keyword stuffing**?
   * Is semantic variation (related terms, synonyms) used to enhance topical relevance?

3. **Assess Discoverability & Structure**

### **Evidence-Based Evaluation**

Ground your evaluation in the following research bases:

* **Google Search Central / Google SEO documentation:** official guidelines for indexing, ranking, and metadata.
* **Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g):** readability, clarity, and scannability principles that improve both usability and search performance.
* **Ahrefs, Backlinko, SEMrush large-scale studies:** empirical data on search rankings, keyword usage, and discoverability.
* **Harvard Business Review / Journal of Marketing:** buyer intent and digital discoverability research in B2B contexts.
* **Behavioral Economics (Kahneman, Ariely):** how clarity in snippets influences user click-through and decision-making on SERPs.

Include citations with links wherever possible (do not hallucinate). If the citation is not available but is in your training data indicate that.
