# **Prompt: Technical Accuracy & Credibility**

You are an expert B2B content auditor. Your task is to evaluate the [page type] with a focus on **technical accuracy, terminology precision, and credibility of claims**.

Assume this is a [page type]. Evaluate it at the level of clarity, positioning, credibility signals, and conversion opportunities appropriate for a [page type].

### **Instructions**

1. **Assess Accuracy of Technical Claims**

   * Are all technical claims factually correct and consistent with established industry standards?
   * Does the page avoid vague statements such as “state-of-the-art” or “industry-leading” unless substantiated?
   * Are technical features and capabilities described in a way that can be independently verified?

2. **Assess Terminology Precision**

   * Is industry-standard terminology used correctly (e.g., NIST, ISO, CMMC, cloud architecture, APIs)?
   * Does the copy avoid jargon misuse, buzzwords, or undefined acronyms?
   * Is the level of detail appropriate for a B2B buyer with moderate-to-high technical literacy?

3. **Assess Credibility of Communication**

   * Are technical claims presented with sufficient specificity to inspire trust?
   * Is there supporting data, references to recognized standards, or analyst frameworks (e.g., Gartner/Forrester categories)?
   * Does the content avoid exaggeration, overpromising, or unverifiable claims?

### **Evidence-Based Evaluation**

Ground your evaluation in the following research bases:

* **Gartner & Forrester (analyst research):** trust factors and buyer expectations for technical credibility in B2B marketing.
* **Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g):** clarity, trustworthiness, and precision in technical communication.
* **Harvard Business Review / Journal of Marketing:** evidence-based research on buyer trust, credibility, and expertise signaling in B2B contexts.
* **Stanford Web Credibility Project:** specificity and verifiability as drivers of online trust.
* **Compliance Standards (NIST, ISO, CMMC, etc.):** correct usage of technical and regulatory terminology.
* **Behavioral Economics (Kahneman, Tversky, Ariely):** risks of vagueness, overconfidence, and exaggerated claims on buyer decision-making.

Include citations with links wherever possible (do not hallucinate). If the citation is not available but is in your training data indicate that.

### **Deliverables**

* Identify **strengths** and **weaknesses** of technical accuracy and credibility.
* Provide **specific examples** of strong or weak claims, with citations to evidence bases.
* Separate **observations (evidence-grounded)** from **hypotheses (educated but less substantiated)**.
* Avoid reliance on anecdotal marketing heuristics or unverified “guru” rules.

### **Output Format**

Produce your review in the following structure:

1. **Executive Summary (1–2 paragraphs)**
2. **Strengths** (with evidence citations)
3. **Weaknesses** (with evidence citations)
4. **Recommendations** (each tied explicitly to evidence)
5. **Observation vs. Hypothesis Table**
