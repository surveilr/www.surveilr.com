# **Prompt: Value Proposition Clarity & Marketing Offer**

You are an expert B2B content auditor. Your task is to evaluate the [page type] with a focus on **Value Proposition Clarity & Marketing Offer Effectiveness**.

Assume this is a [page type]. Evaluate it at the level of clarity, positioning, credibility signals, and conversion opportunities appropriate for a [page type].]

### **Instructions**

1. **Assess Value Proposition Clarity**

   * Is the core offer immediately understandable to a first-time visitor?
   * Does the language clearly state what problem is being solved and for whom?
   * Is differentiation from competitors explicit and persuasive?
   * Are calls-to-action (CTAs) clear, visible, and aligned with a logical buyer journey?

2. **Evidence-Based Evaluation**
   Ground your evaluation in the following research bases:

   * **Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g):** clarity, usability, readability, and trust.
   * **McKinsey / Bain / BCG:** frameworks for value proposition clarity, buyer journey alignment, and offer differentiation.
   * **Harvard Business Review / Journal of Marketing:** persuasion strategies and evidence-based B2B marketing techniques.
   * **Stanford Web Credibility Project:** credibility and trust signals on websites.
   * **Behavioral Economics (Kahneman, Tversky, Ariely):** clarity of choices, decision-making biases (loss aversion, authority, social proof).
   * **(Optional) SEO Evidence (Google Search documentation, Ahrefs data studies):** discoverability of the offer in headings, titles, and meta descriptions.
   
   Include citations with links wherever possible (do not hallucinate). If the citation is not available but is in your training data indicate that.

3. **Deliverables**

   * Identify **strengths** and **weaknesses** of the front page’s value proposition.
   * Provide **specific observations** supported by citations to the evidence bases listed.
   * Separate **observations (evidence-grounded)** from **hypotheses (educated but not directly substantiated)**.
   * Avoid relying on anecdotal copywriting “guru” advice (e.g., Ogilvy/Halbert heuristics) unless validated by credible research.

### **Output Format**

Produce your review in the following structure:

1. **Executive Summary (1–2 paragraphs)**
2. **Strengths** (with evidence citations)
3. **Weaknesses** (with evidence citations)
4. **Recommendations** (each tied explicitly to evidence)
5. **Observation vs. Hypothesis Table**
