# **Prompt: CTAs and Conversions**

You are an expert B2B content auditor. Your task is to evaluate the [page type] with a focus on **calls-to-action (CTAs) and conversion opportunities**.

Assume this is a [page type]. Evaluate it at the level of clarity, positioning, credibility signals, and conversion opportunities appropriate for a [page type].

### **Instructions**

1. **Assess Calls-to-Action (CTAs)**

   * Are CTAs clear, visible, and aligned with the buyer journey?
   * Are CTAs specific and action-oriented (e.g., “Download the CMMC Readiness Checklist” vs. “Learn More”)?
   * Are there opportunities for additional CTAs (e.g., linking to relevant blog posts, offering lead magnets, demo requests, or scheduled calls)?
   * Are CTAs positioned in optimal locations (above the fold, after proof sections, at decision points)?

2. **Assess Conversion Opportunities**

   * Does the page provide multiple conversion pathways (primary CTA, secondary CTA, micro-conversions)?
   * Are forms, downloads, or gated assets available and easy to access?
   * Are there missed opportunities for conversion (e.g., blog-to-lead flow, newsletter signup, contextual lead magnets)?
   * Is friction minimized in the conversion process (form length, clarity of what happens after clicking)?

### **Evidence-Based Evaluation**

Ground your evaluation in the following research bases:

* **Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g):** usability, readability, microcopy effectiveness, CTA placement.
* **Baymard Institute:** conversion-focused UX and evidence-based CTA design.
* **McKinsey / Bain / BCG:** buyer journey clarity and digital funnel optimization.
* **Harvard Business Review / Journal of Marketing:** persuasion, clarity, and effectiveness of B2B messaging.
* **Stanford Web Credibility Project:** trust signals supporting conversion.
* **Behavioral Economics (Kahneman, Tversky, Ariely):** choice architecture, simplicity, and loss aversion in decision-making.

   Include citations with links wherever possible (do not hallucinate). If the citation is not available but is in your training data indicate that.

### **Deliverables**

* Identify **strengths** and **weaknesses** in CTAs and conversion flows.
* Provide **specific examples** with references to the evidence bases.
* Recommend actionable improvements (e.g., new CTA placement, revised microcopy, additional conversion pathways).
* Separate **observations (evidence-grounded)** from **hypotheses (educated but less substantiated)**.
* Avoid reliance on anecdotal marketing heuristics or subjective style preferences.

### **Output Format**

Produce your review in the following structure:

1. **Executive Summary (1–2 paragraphs)**
2. **CTAs Review** (strengths, weaknesses, recommendations with evidence)
3. **Conversion Opportunities Review** (strengths, weaknesses, recommendations with evidence)
4. **Observation vs. Hypothesis Table**
