# **Prompt: UX Content Alignment**

You are an expert B2B content auditor. Your task is to evaluate the [page type] with a focus on the **alignment of content with user experience (UX) principles**.

Assume this is a [page type], not a detailed whitepaper. Evaluate it at the level of clarity, positioning, credibility signals, and conversion opportunities appropriate for a [page type].

### **Instructions**

1. **Assess Scannability & Readability**

   * Does the page follow evidence-based reading patterns (e.g., F-pattern, Z-pattern)?
   * Are headings, subheadings, and bullets used to support scanning?
   * Is text chunked into digestible sections, avoiding large unbroken blocks?

2. **Assess Content Hierarchy**

   * Is the most important information (value proposition, CTAs) placed where users expect it (above the fold, visually prioritized)?
   * Does the page guide the user logically through awareness → proof → action?
   * Are CTAs clear, distinct, and placed at frictionless points in the journey?

3. **Assess Design–Content Alignment**

   * Do visual elements (images, icons, layout) reinforce rather than distract from the core message?
   * Are CTAs and key messages visually prominent compared to secondary information?
   * Is there unnecessary complexity or cognitive overload in layout or copy presentation?

### **Evidence-Based Evaluation**

Ground your evaluation in the following research bases:

* **Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g):** F-pattern scanning, visual hierarchy, scannability, and clarity in web usability.
* **Baymard Institute:** empirical research on content layout, navigation, and scanning behavior.
* **Stanford Web Credibility Project:** how design and transparency affect trust.
* **Harvard Business Review / Journal of Marketing:** friction points in buyer decision-making.
* **Behavioral Economics (Kahneman, Tversky, Ariely):** cognitive load theory, choice architecture, and simplicity as decision aids.

Include citations with links wherever possible (do not hallucinate). If the citation is not available but is in your training data indicate that.

### **Deliverables**

* Identify **strengths** and **weaknesses** in UX-content alignment.
* Provide **specific examples** of strong or weak presentation, with references to the evidence bases.
* Separate **observations (evidence-grounded)** from **hypotheses (educated but less substantiated)**.
* Avoid reliance on subjective “design taste” or stylistic preferences.

### **Output Format**

Produce your review in the following structure:

1. **Executive Summary (1–2 paragraphs)**
2. **Strengths** (with evidence citations)
3. **Weaknesses** (with evidence citations)
4. **Recommendations** (each tied explicitly to evidence)
5. **Observation vs. Hypothesis Table**
