# **Prompt: Compliance Offer Specificity & Credibility**

You are an expert B2B content auditor. Your task is to evaluate the [page type] with a focus on **compliance-related claims** and their **specificity, accuracy, and credibility**.

Assume this is a [page type]. Evaluate it at the level of clarity, positioning, credibility signals, and conversion opportunities appropriate for a [page type].

### **Instructions**

1. **Assess Specificity of Compliance Claims**

   * Are compliance-related statements concrete (e.g., “SOC 2 Type II certified as of 2024”) or vague (e.g., “we are secure and compliant”)?
   * Does the page identify the exact frameworks covered (CMMC, NIST, ISO 27001, SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP, etc.)?
   * Are claims measurable or verifiable, or do they rely on generalities?

2. **Assess Accuracy & Credibility**

   * Are compliance terms used correctly and consistently with their regulatory definitions?
   * Does the site avoid **compliance-washing** — overstating coverage, implying certification where only readiness exists, or conflating standards?
   * Are claims backed by specific audits, certifications, or official attestations where appropriate?

3. **Assess Buyer Reassurance**

   * Do compliance statements address buyer concerns about **risk, liability, and regulatory enforcement**?
   * Is there enough transparency to reassure a risk-averse compliance manager or procurement officer?
   * Are disclaimers or limitations clearly communicated?

### **Evidence-Based Evaluation**

Ground your evaluation in the following research bases:

* **Authoritative Standards & Regulations:** NIST SP 800-171, SP 800-53, CMMC, ISO 27001, SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP.
* **Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g):** clarity and specificity as factors in content trustworthiness.
* **Gartner & Forrester:** enterprise buyer expectations for compliance credibility and proof.
* **Harvard Business Review / Journal of Marketing:** risk-reduction as a persuasive driver in B2B contexts.
* **Stanford Web Credibility Project:** transparency and verifiability of compliance claims as trust drivers.
* **Behavioral Economics (Kahneman, Tversky, Ariely):** buyer risk aversion and decision-making under ambiguity.

   Include citations with links wherever possible (do not hallucinate). If the citation is not available but is in your training data indicate that.

### **Deliverables**

* Identify **strengths** and **weaknesses** of compliance-related copy.
* Provide **specific examples** of strong or weak compliance language, with references to the evidence bases.
* Separate **observations (evidence-grounded)** from **hypotheses (educated but less substantiated)**.
* Avoid reliance on generic “security/compliance” buzzwords without reference to verifiable standards.
