# Together.Health Security Assessment (THSA) Policy Document

## Introduction
The secure destruction of media is crucial in safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. As organizations increasingly rely on digital media for storing and processing data, the risk of unauthorized access to this information during its lifecycle escalates. Secure media destruction not only mitigates the risk of data breaches but also ensures that organizations adhere to standards and practices that protect their assets, reputation, and legal standing.

## Policy Statement
Together.Health is committed to the secure destruction of media that is no longer required for business or legal reasons. This policy ensures that all sensitive information is rendered irretrievable in accordance with applicable laws and industry standards, thus minimizing risks associated with data exposure.

## Scope
This policy applies to all media—physical and digital—across all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team: Conduct Media Audit + Quarterly**: Regularly review and identify media that is no longer needed for business or legal reasons.
- **Data Owners: Initiate Destruction Process + As Needed**: Request the secure destruction of identified media following the audit.
- **Operations Team: Execute Media Destruction + As Directed**: Perform the physical or digital destruction of media and document the process.
- **Compliance Officer: Review Destruction Records + Annually**: Ensure all media destruction activities are compliant and properly documented.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**:
   The organization must securely destroy media when it is no longer needed for business or legal reasons to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. This includes implementing and maintaining procedures that align with industry best practices for data destruction.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**:
   Employ automatable methods such as OSquery to monitor and log media destruction activities. This can include tracking the execution of destruction commands and confirming the deletion of files or the physical shredding of devices.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**:
   Designate personnel to confirm the completion of the destruction process by signing off on destruction logs. They must document the date, method of destruction, and any relevant identifiers. This information should be ingested into Surveilr for audit and compliance purposes.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following **SMART** objectives:
- **Specific**: All media identified for destruction must be logged.
- **Measurable**: 100% of documented destruction activities must match with automated logs.
- **Achievable**: Destruction must be performed within a defined timeframe post-authorization.
- **Relevant**: All destruction methods must be compliant with industry standards.
- **Time-bound**: Compliance audits must occur annually to verify adherence to this policy.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may occur under specific circumstances, such as legal holds or pending litigation. All exceptions must be documented, including the rationale and approval from the Compliance Officer.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs related to media destruction must be retained for a minimum of **five years** to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance to current laws and practices.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through documented attestation. Comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions related to media destruction must be maintained, and formal documentation must be kept for all exceptions.
