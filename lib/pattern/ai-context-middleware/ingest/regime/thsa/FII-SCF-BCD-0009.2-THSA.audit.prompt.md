You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** Together.Health Security Assessment (THSA)
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization identifies potential accessibility problems at the alternate processing site and possible mitigation actions, in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster.
Control Code: [FII-SCF-BCD-0009.2],
Control Question: Does the organization identify potential accessibility problems to the alternate processing site and possible mitigation actions, in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-BCD-0009.2"
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "In an increasingly unpredictable world, organizations must prioritize the identification of potential accessibility problems at alternate processing sites during area-wide disruptions or disasters. This policy outlines the procedures for identifying these issues and implementing mitigation strategies to ensure business continuity and the protection of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). The organization commits to identifying potential accessibility problems at alternate processing sites and developing effective mitigation actions in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster. This proactive approach is essential for maintaining business continuity and ensuring compliance with applicable regulations."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Evidence of accessibility assessments conducted quarterly, including reports generated via OSquery for alternate processing site checks, signed assessments by the Business Continuity Manager confirming accessibility issues and proposed actions, and documentation of mitigation actions taken within the stipulated timeframe. Specific reports from the last two quarters are available for review."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: Together.Health Security Assessment (THSA) - FII-SCF-BCD-0009.2

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., Business Continuity Auditor]
**Control Code:** [FII-SCF-BCD-0009.2]
**Control Question:** [Does the organization identify potential accessibility problems to the alternate processing site and possible mitigation actions, in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster?]
**Internal ID (FII):** [FII-SCF-BCD-0009.2]
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** [The organization identifies potential accessibility problems at the alternate processing site and possible mitigation actions, in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster.]

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Quarterly assessments of alternate processing site accessibility.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Evidence of quarterly accessibility assessments conducted, including reports generated via OSquery.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated evidence collection using OSquery for checking alternate processing site accessibility.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM accessibility_reports WHERE assessment_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 6 MONTH);
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence provided shows completed assessments for the last two quarters, meeting the control's requirements.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Submission of mitigation action reports within two weeks of assessment.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Documentation of mitigation actions taken within the stipulated timeframe.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Records of action items generated from accessibility assessment reports.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM mitigation_actions WHERE action_date <= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 14 DAY);
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** Mitigation actions were documented and implemented within the required two-week timeframe.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Signed assessments confirming accessibility issues and proposed actions.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed assessment report from the Business Continuity Manager.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Quarterly signing of assessment reports by the Business Continuity Manager.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Stored signed PDF of the assessment report.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
