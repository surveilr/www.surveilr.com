## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the organization's contingency plans are effectively aligned with evolving business needs and technological advancements. Keeping these plans current is crucial for minimizing disruption during unexpected events and ensuring organizational resilience. By regularly updating and reviewing our contingency plans, we can enhance our response capabilities, safeguard electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.

## 2. Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to the continuous maintenance and updating of contingency plans. This commitment is essential for protecting our operations, ensuring rapid recovery from incidents, and adapting to changes in our business environment and technological landscape.
