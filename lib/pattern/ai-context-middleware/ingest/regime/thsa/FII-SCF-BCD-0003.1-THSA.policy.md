## Introduction

In today's dynamic environment, organizations must be prepared for unexpected disruptions that could impact their operations and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). This policy outlines the requirements for incorporating simulated events into contingency training, ensuring effective responses by personnel during crisis situations. By following this policy, the organization will foster a culture of preparedness and resilience, ultimately enhancing its business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) capabilities.

## Policy Statement

The organization is committed to incorporating simulated events into its contingency training programs. This will ensure that personnel are adequately prepared to respond effectively to crises, thereby minimizing potential disruptions to services and safeguarding ePHI. All training sessions will utilize **SMART** objectives to ensure measurable outcomes and continuous improvement.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- All organizational personnel involved in business continuity and disaster recovery processes.
- Cloud-hosted systems and SaaS applications utilized for storing, processing, or transmitting ePHI.
- Third-party vendor systems that interface with organizational data.
- All channels for creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting ePHI.

## Responsibilities

- **Business Continuity Manager**: Oversee the development and implementation of simulation exercises; ensure compliance with training requirements.
- **IT Security Team**: Provide technical support for simulation tools and assist in evidence collection.
- **Department Heads**: Ensure personnel participation in training and adherence to the policy.
- **Training Coordinators**: Facilitate training sessions and collect feedback for continuous improvement.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT:
Incorporate simulated events in contingency training programs for effective personnel response during crises.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
- Utilize automated survey tools to assess training effectiveness post-simulation.
- Implement logging mechanisms in training software to capture attendance and participation metrics.
- Generate reports reflecting the completion rates and performance evaluations tied to **KPIs/SLAs**.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
- Personnel must complete a post-training survey and provide feedback on the simulation effectiveness.
- Training coordinators will collect signed acknowledgment forms from participants confirming their understanding of the training.
- Submit feedback and survey results into Surveilr for compliance tracking.

## Verification Criteria

- At least 90% of personnel must participate in simulation training annually.
- Improvement in crisis response effectiveness measured through post-training evaluations must exceed 75% satisfaction.
- Documentation of training sessions, participant lists, and feedback must be maintained and reviewed regularly against the established **KPIs/SLAs**.

## Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Business Continuity Manager. Exceptions will be reviewed during the **Annual Review** of this policy.

## Lifecycle Requirements

- Evidence and logs related to training activities must be retained for a minimum of **Data Retention** period of 3 years.
- The policy will be reviewed and updated annually to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through a signed form. Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for all critical actions, including participation in training and completion of feedback forms. Any exceptions will be formally documented and submitted for review.
