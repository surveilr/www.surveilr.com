You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "" (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0003.1). 

The policy must follow this structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Ensure that **References subsections do not appear within each policy section** and that the document ends with exactly ONE References section.

Each policy section must adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: Use H2 headings (##) for each major requirement. Each section should explain the control requirement, suggest machine attestation methods, and outline human attestation methods where necessary.

2. **Markdown Elements**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Format citation links for external references as [Link Text](URL).

3. **Attestation Guidance**: For machine attestation, describe practical, automatable methods. For human attestation, specify the actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.

4. **Policy Structure**: Follow the mandatory order of sections. 

5. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions, including a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

6. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Clearly define the policy's scope, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels for creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting ePHI.

7. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

8. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr when needed.

9. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned and explicitly reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

10. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

11. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.

12. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods without writing or embedding SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

13. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

14. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs.

15. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting throughout the document.

16. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

17. **Final Section Requirements**: The References section must be the FINAL section of the policy document, containing only one single line if no external references exist.

18. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

Begin authoring the policy now, ensuring all requirements are met and that the structure is precisely followed.
