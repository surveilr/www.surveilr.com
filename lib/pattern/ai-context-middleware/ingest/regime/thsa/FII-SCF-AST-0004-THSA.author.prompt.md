You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "Does the organization maintain network architecture diagrams that: ▪ Contain sufficient detail to assess the security of the network's architecture; ▪ Reflect the current state of the network environment; and ▪ Document all sensitive data flows?" (FII: FII-SCF-AST-0004). 

The policy must follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy and its importance in maintaining network security.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to maintaining detailed and accurate network architecture diagrams.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, explicitly covering all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify granular roles and task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in maintaining the network architecture diagrams.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Explain the control requirement regarding network architecture diagrams.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence, such as using tools to verify diagram accuracy against network configurations.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Define specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods for human attestations when automation is impractical.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, tied to **SMART** instructions and **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for documenting them.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence and the frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Specify requirements for workforce member acknowledgment/attestation and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

10. **References**: Include a single section at the end of the document with external references in the format [Link Text](URL). 

Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections, and that each section includes appropriate attestation guidance maximizing machine attestability. The final document must contain exactly ONE References section.
