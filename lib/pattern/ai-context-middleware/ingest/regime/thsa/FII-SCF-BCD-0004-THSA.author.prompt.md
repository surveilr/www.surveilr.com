You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0004). 

The policy must incorporate the following structure and requirements:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Ensure that each section is clearly labeled with H2 headings (##).

2. **Policy Content**: Each section should:
   - Explain the control requirement.
   - Suggest machine attestation methods that can be automated via Surveilr.
   - Suggest human attestation methods where automation is impractical.

3. **Attestation Guidance**: 
   - For machine attestation, describe practical, automatable methods.
   - For human attestation, detail specific actions, artifacts, and how they are ingested into Surveilr.

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like containment or correction, include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

5. **Scope Definition**: The policy's scope must explicitly include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

6. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

7. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when needed.

8. **Responsibilities Section**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using action verbs and frequency. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

11. **Prohibited Content**: Do not write or embed SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code. Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections.

12. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

13. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

14. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

15. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

16. **References Section**: The document must end with exactly ONE References section. 

17. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

18. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section** of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else. 

Ensure that References subsections do NOT appear after each policy section and only ONE References section exists at the document end.
