You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization identify potential accessibility problems to the alternate processing site and possible mitigation actions, in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster?" (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0009.2). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy **MUST** follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Ensure that there are no References subsections within each section; the single References section should only appear at the very end of the document.

2. **Policy Section Formatting**: Use H2 headings (##) for each major requirement. Each section should include:
   - An explanation of the control requirement.
   - Suggested machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
   - Suggested human attestation methods where unavoidable (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report").

3. **Attestation Guidance**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation and define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr for human attestation when necessary.

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, along with a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

5. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and **all channels** used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Include clear measurable criteria for compliance validation that are directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the operational steps.

7. **Responsibilities Section**: Define specific task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned and link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

8. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require **Workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, along with comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

10. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods, avoiding SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

11. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

12. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text **MUST** explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

13. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document.** Ensure it contains exactly ONE References section after the policy content.

Provide a comprehensive policy that achieves a 100% compliance score by addressing every rule in the 'Requirements for the Policy Document' section.
