You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization conduct a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and 'lessons learned' activity every time the contingency plan is activated?" (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0005).

1. **Document Structure**: The policy MUST include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Ensure that each section follows the guidelines without including References subsections within the individual sections. The References section should appear only at the end of the document.

2. **Attestation Guidance**: For each section, explain the control requirement, suggest machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily"), and outline human attestation methods if necessary (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report"). Prioritize **machine attestability** by detailing how evidence will be collected and verified.

3. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, alongside a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

4. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and **all channels** used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

5. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section MUST define **specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency)** for each role mentioned. Explicitly link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

6. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: The policy MUST contain a subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

7. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: The policy MUST require **Workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance as well as **Comprehensive audit logging** for all critical actions.

8. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Structure the Evidence Collection Methods section with numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

9. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation that tie directly to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the operational detail.

10. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code. Ensure to use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

11. **Keyword Emphasis**: Explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

12. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section must be the FINAL section** of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else.
