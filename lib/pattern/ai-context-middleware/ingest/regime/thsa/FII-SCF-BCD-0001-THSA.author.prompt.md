You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization facilitate the implementation of contingency planning controls?" (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0001). 

The policy must follow this structure without including any References subsections in the individual sections, and must end with exactly ONE References section. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy, its purpose, and its importance in the context of Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to implementing contingency planning controls and ensuring compliance.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved in the policy, such as Compliance Officer and IT Security. Explicitly link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use the mandatory structure:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest machine attestation methods, describing how evidence will be collected and validated.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify human attestation methods, detailing the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document, using the format [Link Text](URL) for external references.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes SMART instructions, and defines all required elements as specified. Keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** must be **BOLD** throughout the policy. Do not embed SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code within the document. 

The policy document must conclude with the single References section, containing either external references or the statement "None" if no external references exist.
