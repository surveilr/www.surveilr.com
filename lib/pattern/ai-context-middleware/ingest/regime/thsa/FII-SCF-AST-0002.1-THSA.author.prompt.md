You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: FII-SCF-AST-0002.1). 

Please follow these instructions to create a comprehensive policy document:

1. Begin with the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Ensure that there are **no References subsections** in any of the policy sections; the References section should be the **final section** of the document.

2. In each section, explain the control requirement clearly. 

3. For **Evidence Collection Methods**, use numbered subheadings per requirement:
   - "1. REQUIREMENT:"
   - "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:"
   - "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:"

4. Use the following guidelines for machine and human attestation:
   - For **Machine Attestation**, describe practical, automatable methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily"). 
   - For **Human Attestation**, provide precise steps and artifacts (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly software inventory report").

5. Ensure that every policy section addresses the goal of maximizing machine attestability. Include specific, verifiable actions for human attestations when automation is impractical.

6. The **Responsibilities** section must define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned, and explicitly link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

7. Clearly define the **scope** of the policy to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

8. Include **SMART** instructions for operational details, ensuring that all processes such as containment, correction, or violation sanction contain a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

9. Include a subsection detailing **minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

10. The policy must require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

11. Ensure to bold the following keywords in the policy text: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

12. Conclude the document with exactly ONE **References** section at the end, formatted as follows:
   - If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format.
   - If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

Remember, do not include any SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code, and do not output any control identifiers, metadata, or additional content after the References section.
