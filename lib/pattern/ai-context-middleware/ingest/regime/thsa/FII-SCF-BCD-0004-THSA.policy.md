## Introduction

This policy outlines the requirements and procedures for conducting tests and exercises to assess the effectiveness of the organization's contingency plan and the readiness to execute that plan. It is vital for ensuring that Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans are effective and that the organization can maintain or quickly resume critical operations in the event of a disruption.

## Policy Statement

The organization is committed to conducting regular tests and exercises of its contingency plans to validate their effectiveness and ensure readiness. This policy mandates that these activities are to be performed at least **annually** and that they include both automated testing methods and manual exercises, as applicable.

## Scope

This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:

- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)

## Responsibilities

- **IT Security Team**: 
  - **Conduct** tests and exercises on contingency plans **annually**.
  - **Review** findings and document outcomes within **two weeks** post-exercise.

- **Business Continuity Manager**: 
  - **Coordinate** the development and execution of all tests and exercises **monthly**.
  - **Communicate** results to stakeholders and ensure action plans are implemented.

- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - **Ensure** adherence to policy requirements and maintain records for compliance reviews **quarterly**.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**: Conduct tests and exercises to validate the contingency plan.
   
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
   - Use automated scripts to generate reports from testing tools that verify the execution of contingency plans without human intervention.
   - Collect logs from automated backup and recovery solutions that detail test outcomes and success rates.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
   - Document the results of manual exercises through incident reports, signed off by involved personnel, and upload these artifacts into Surveilr for review and compliance tracking.

## Verification Criteria

Verification will be based on the following **SMART** criteria:

- **Successful execution** of 100% of scheduled tests exercises **annually**.
- **Documentation of outcomes** from all tests must be uploaded to Surveilr within **two weeks** post-exercise.
- **Post-exercise review meetings** should occur within **one month** of each test to discuss findings and improvements.

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy must be documented and require approval from the Compliance Officer. All exceptions will be logged and reviewed during the **annual audit** of the policy.

## Lifecycle Requirements

- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs related to tests and exercises must be retained for a minimum of **five years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy shall be reviewed and updated **annually** to ensure its ongoing effectiveness and relevance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to understanding and complying with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for all critical actions taken during tests and exercises. Formal documentation of any exceptions must also be preserved.
