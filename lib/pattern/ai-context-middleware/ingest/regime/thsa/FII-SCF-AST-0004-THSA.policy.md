# Together.Health Security Assessment (THSA) Policy Document

## 1. Introduction
This policy outlines the guidelines for maintaining network architecture diagrams within the organization. Network architecture diagrams are essential for assessing and enhancing the security of our network environments. By ensuring that these diagrams are detailed, current, and inclusive of sensitive data flows, we can proactively identify vulnerabilities, optimize network performance, and comply with regulatory requirements. This policy serves to establish a consistent approach to diagram maintenance across all systems and environments.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to maintaining accurate and detailed network architecture diagrams that provide sufficient information to assess the security of our network architecture, reflect the current state of the network environment, and document all sensitive data flows. This commitment is critical to safeguarding our assets and ensuring compliance with security standards.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all organizational units, systems, and environments, including but not limited to:
- On-premises infrastructure
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems

All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors involved in network management and architecture are subject to this policy.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Network Architects**: 
  - **Develop** and update network architecture diagrams **quarterly**.
  - **Review** diagrams for accuracy and completeness **monthly**.
  
- **Security Team**: 
  - **Evaluate** the security implications of network diagrams **annually**.
  - **Document** any security vulnerabilities identified in diagrams **as they occur**.

- **IT Operations**: 
  - **Maintain** real-time updates of the network architecture diagrams **continuously**.
  - **Notify** stakeholders of any changes in the network that impact diagrams **immediately**.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
### 1. REQUIREMENT
The organization must maintain network architecture diagrams that:
- Contain sufficient detail for security assessments.
- Reflect the current state of the network environment.
- Document all sensitive data flows.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION
Automatable methods for collecting evidence include:
- Utilizing network monitoring tools to compare live configurations to architectural diagrams, generating automated reports on discrepancies.
- Implementing version control systems to track changes made to diagrams.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION
When automation is impractical, the following actions are required:
- Network architects must submit a signed attestation form confirming the accuracy of diagrams after each update.
- Maintain a log of all manual reviews conducted and any changes made, including dates and responsible individuals.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be assessed based on the following SMART criteria:
- **Specific**: Diagrams must include all critical network components and data flows.
- **Measurable**: Diagrams must be evaluated for completeness against a checklist.
- **Achievable**: A review process will be established to ensure diagrams are updated quarterly.
- **Relevant**: All sensitive data flows must be accurately documented in the diagrams.
- **Time-bound**: Compliance reviews will occur annually, with KPIs tied to the percentage of diagrams meeting the completeness checklist.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Security Team. Exceptions must include the rationale for the deviation and a mitigation plan outlining the risks associated with the exception.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence related to network architecture diagrams, including attestation forms and logs, must be retained for a minimum of five years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will be reviewed annually to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members responsible for maintaining network architecture diagrams must acknowledge their understanding of this policy through a formal attestation process. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained, documenting all actions related to the creation, update, and review of network architecture diagrams.
