You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization establish an alternate storage site that includes both the assets and necessary agreements to permit the storage and recovery of system backup information?" (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0008). 

Please follow the exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Each section must include:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy focus and importance of backup information storage.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the policy regarding alternate storage sites for system backup information.
3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope, covering all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly review of agreements; IT Security: monthly validation of backup locations).
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Describe the specific control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Use API integrations with cloud providers to confirm the existence of backup agreements").
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Provide precise actions and artifacts necessary for human attestation (e.g., "A designated manager must sign off on the annual review of the alternate storage site agreements").
6. **Verification Criteria**: Specify clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **SMART** objectives and **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline any potential exceptions to the policy and the approval process for these exceptions.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence (e.g., "retain backup agreements for 6 years") and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., "reviewed at least annually").
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require acknowledgment from workforce members regarding understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that all policy sections maximize machine attestability, with clear examples of automated evidence collection and well-defined human attestation methods where necessary. Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. 

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections. The References section should appear ONLY at the very end of the document. Conclude the document with exactly ONE References section.
