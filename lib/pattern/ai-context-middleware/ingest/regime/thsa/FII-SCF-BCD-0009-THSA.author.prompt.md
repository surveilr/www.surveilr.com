You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization establish an alternate processing site that provides security measures equivalent to that of the primary site?" (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0009).

## Policy Structure

1. **Introduction:** Briefly explain the purpose of this policy and its importance in ensuring continuity of operations.
  
2. **Policy Statement:** State the organization's commitment to maintaining an alternate processing site that meets security standards.
  
3. **Scope:** Define the scope of this policy, explicitly including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities:** Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in maintaining the alternate processing site. Link to any related organizational plans, such as the Business Continuity Plan.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods:**
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Describe the requirement for establishing an alternate processing site.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical, automatable methods for attestation, such as collecting configuration data through OSquery or validating site security through API integrations.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Describe precise actions, artifacts, and how they are documented and ingested into Surveilr (e.g., management review of site security quarterly).

6. **Verification Criteria:** Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the policy.

7. **Exceptions:** Outline any exceptions to this policy and the process for granting them.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements:** Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least **annually**').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit:** Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
