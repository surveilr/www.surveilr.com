You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: FII-SCF-AST-0002). 

### Policy Authoring Instructions:

1. **Document Structure**: Begin with the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** 

2. **Policy Sections**:
   - Each section must explain the control requirement and include the following:
     - **Machine Attestation Methods**: Provide practical, automatable methods for evidence collection and validation via Surveilr. 
       - For example, "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily."
     - **Human Attestation Methods**: Describe specific actions and artifacts when automation is impractical.
       - For example, "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly software inventory report."
   - **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections. 

3. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include bulleted lists of 3-5 operational steps with specific time-bound metrics (KPIs/SLA).

4. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

5. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

6. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when necessary.

7. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section must define specific task-level duties for each role and explicitly link to related organizational plans.

8. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Each requirement must use numbered subheadings: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

11. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

12. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code where necessary.

13. **Hyperlinks**: Use the [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

14. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end.

15. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

16. **Final Section Requirements**: The References section is the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else.

### Instructions for the AI:
- Ensure that the policy you create does not contain any SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code. 
- End the policy document with exactly ONE References section. 
- Emphasize that References subsections should NOT appear after each policy section.
