This policy outlines the organization's commitment to establishing and maintaining an alternate processing site that provides security measures equivalent to those of the primary site.

### 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to the establishment of an alternate processing site that implements security measures meeting or exceeding those in place at the primary processing site. This commitment is essential for the resilience and security of our operations, particularly concerning the protection of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

### 3. Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities, including but not limited to:

### 8. Lifecycle Requirements
