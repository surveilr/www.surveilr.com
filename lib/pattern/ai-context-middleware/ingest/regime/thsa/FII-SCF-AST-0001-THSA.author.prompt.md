You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization facilitate the implementation of asset management controls?" (FII: FII-SCF-AST-0001).

## Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**: Introduce the purpose of the policy and its importance in asset management controls.
   
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to implementing robust asset management controls.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, explicitly including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Outline specific, task-level duties using **Action Verb + Frequency** for roles involved in asset management, linking to related organizational plans as necessary.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Provide detailed methods for collecting evidence, structured as follows:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Define the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly software inventory report").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **SMART** **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Describe any exceptions to the policy, including how they will be documented and approved.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least **annually**').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: The document must conclude with a single References section, containing all external references in the format [Link Text](URL). There should be no References subsections within policy sections.

## Formatting Guidelines

- Use H2 headings (##) for each major requirement.
- Utilize standard Markdown elements: paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
- Emphasize and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the policy.
- Ensure no SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code are included.
- Maintain a strict adherence to the mandated order of policy sections.

End the policy document with exactly ONE References section. Ensure that no References subsections appear after each policy section.
