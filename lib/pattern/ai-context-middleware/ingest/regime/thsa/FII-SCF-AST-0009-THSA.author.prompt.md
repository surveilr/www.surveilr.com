You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization securely destroy media when it is no longer needed for business or legal reasons?" (FII: FII-SCF-AST-0009). 

The policy must follow this structure:

## Introduction
- Provide a brief overview of the importance of securely destroying media and its relevance to compliance and security.

## Policy Statement
- Clearly state the organization's commitment to securely destroying media that is no longer needed.

## Scope
- Define the policy's scope, including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in the media destruction process.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT:
   - Explain the control requirement in detail.
   
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using OSquery or logging mechanisms to track destruction activities.

3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - Describe specific, verifiable actions a human must perform, including how they will document these actions and ensure ingestion into Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the **SMART** objectives defined in the policy.

## Exceptions
- Define any exceptions to the policy, including how these will be documented and approved.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Include minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and specify the **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

### References
- This section should contain exactly one reference list using the format [Link Text](URL) or state "None" if no external references exist.

Ensure that all sections contain necessary details, use **bold** for emphasized keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. References subsections must not appear after each policy section and should only be included as the final section of the document.
