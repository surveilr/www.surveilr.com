You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "The organization restricts the use of writable, removable media and personally owned, removable media in organizational systems." (FII: FII-SCF-DCH-0012). 

Please follow these instructions to create a robust policy document:

1. **Document Structure**: Use the following section order: Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, and finally, References. Ensure that no References subsections appear within policy sections.

2. **Policy Sections**: Each major requirement must be formatted using H2 headings (##). Explain the control requirement, suggest machine attestation methods, and provide human attestation methods where automation is impractical. 

3. **Attestation Guidance**: 
   - For **Machine Attestation**, describe practical, automatable methods such as collecting data via OSquery or using API integrations.
   - For **Human Attestation**, define precise steps and artifacts, detailing how human evidence is documented and ingested into Surveilr.

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, along with a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

5. **Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

6. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

7. **Explicit Human Attestation**: When necessary, define the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.

8. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned in the Responsibilities section, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format, and link to related organizational plans.

9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

11. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use the mandatory structure with numbered subheadings for each requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

12. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined earlier.

13. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

14. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

15. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end. Do not include control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content after the References section.

16. **Keyword Emphasis**: Ensure the policy text explicitly uses and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

Remember that the References section is the FINAL section of the policy document, and no References subsections should appear after each policy section. 

End the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
