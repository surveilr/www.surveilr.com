You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 0113.04a1Organizational.2 (FII: FII-SCF-IRO-0012). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and requirements:

1. **Introduction**: Clearly state the purpose and scope of the policy and communicate management's commitment to information security.

2. **Policy Statement**: Define the organization's approach to managing information security.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, such as Compliance Officer (quarterly policy approval) and IT Security (daily log review). Link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Each method must be detailed as follows:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for validating compliance.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Provide specific verifiable actions and how documentation will be ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including documentation requirements.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **Final Section Requirements**: Ensure the **References** section is the final section of the policy document, with no Reference subsections appearing in individual policy sections. 

Make sure to use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Emphasize the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** by making them bold. 

Conclude the document with exactly ONE References section. If there are external references, format them using [Link Text](URL). If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None". 

Do not include any control identifiers, metadata, or additional content after the References section.
