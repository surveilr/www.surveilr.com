# HiTRUST Compliance Policy for Control: 07.10m1Organizational (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0002)

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for maintaining the security of organizational systems through timely and efficient software updates. Implementing automated and manual software update processes is critical in mitigating vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance, and protecting sensitive information from potential threats. This policy emphasizes the importance of machine attestability in the software update lifecycle, providing a reliable method for validating compliance.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to deploying automated software update tools to ensure that all systems operate with the most recent security updates provided by software vendors. For systems that do not support automated updates, manual processes will be established to guarantee that updates are consistently applied. This dual approach ensures comprehensive coverage for all systems within our environment.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems

All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who manage or utilize these systems are subject to this policy.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security: daily review of update logs** to ensure compliance with update requirements.
- **System Administrators: bi-weekly verification of automated updates** to confirm successful installations and address any failures.
- **Compliance Officer: quarterly review of software update processes** to ensure adherence to policy guidelines.
- **Management: annual certification of update procedures** to validate that all systems are updated and in compliance.

Escalation procedures for unresolved issues will follow the organizational incident response plan.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:** All systems must utilize automated software update tools wherever feasible to ensure up-to-date software.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Evidence will be collected through API integrations with software vendors to validate that updates have been applied successfully. Logs will be automatically generated and stored in a secure repository.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Managers will certify quarterly that all systems are updated. Certification artifacts will include signed attestations and logs of updates, which will be ingested into Surveilr for review.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be assessed based on the following **SMART** **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 95% of systems must successfully install updates within 24 hours of release.
- All manual update processes must be completed within 48 hours of detection of a required update.
- Quarterly attestations must be submitted by 100% of managers responsible for system oversight.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and require justification. The process for requesting an exception includes:
- Submission of an Exception Request Form to the Compliance Officer.
- Review and approval by the IT Security team.
- All exceptions must be formally documented and logged for audit purposes.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** Evidence and logs related to software updates must be retained for a minimum of 3 years.
- **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update:** This policy must be reviewed at least **annually** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to software updates, including any exceptions. Formal documentation will be required for all exceptions, ensuring a clear audit trail.
