You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "0226.09k1Organizational.2" (FII: FII-SCF-END-0004.2). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidance:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy **MUST** include the following sections in the exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** for processes such as containment, correction, or violation sanction, along with a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and **all channels** used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation**: When automation is impractical, define the exact human action, artifact, and how it will be ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Define **specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency)** for each role mentioned in the Responsibilities section. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

9. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods; do not write or embed SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

10. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

11. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

12. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

13. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

14. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the end. 

15. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text **MUST** explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

16. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section** of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else.

17. **References Section Format**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None". 

Ensure that no References subsections appear after each policy section, and conclude the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
