# Wireless Access Policy

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this Wireless Access Policy is to establish a comprehensive security framework to govern the approval and management of wireless access within the organization. Given the sensitive nature of data transmitted over wireless networks, this policy is crucial for protecting organizational assets from unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with industry standards. The implementation of robust security measures, including encryption protocols, mitigates risks associated with wireless communications.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to ensuring that all wireless access is explicitly approved and that all wireless access points and devices utilize robust encryption protocols. Only devices that meet the organization's security standards shall be permitted to connect to the wireless network, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational data.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all entities within the organization, including all departments, employees, contractors, and third-party vendors. It encompasses all environments and systems, including on-premises infrastructure, cloud-hosted systems, and any external systems that may connect to the organizational network wirelessly.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - **Review** wireless access requests **weekly** to ensure compliance with security standards.
  - **Audit** wireless access logs **monthly** to detect unauthorized access.

- **Network Administration**: 
  - **Configure** wireless access points with approved encryption settings **upon installation**.
  - **Monitor** network traffic for anomalies **daily**.

- **Employees**: 
  - **Submit** wireless access requests **prior to connecting** any personal devices to the corporate network.
  - **Complete** security awareness training **annually**.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: All wireless access must be explicitly approved by the IT Security Team, and encryption protocols, such as AES WPA2, must be enabled on all wireless access points and devices.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automated tools will be employed to verify that only approved devices are connected to the wireless network. Continuous monitoring will ensure that encryption protocols like AES WPA2 are enforced and functioning correctly, with alerts generated for non-compliance.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The IT manager must provide a signed document certifying that all wireless access points and devices have been reviewed and approved for compliance with this policy.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated based on the following measurable criteria:
- Percentage of wireless access requests approved within 5 business days (Target: 95%).
- Number of unauthorized access incidents reported (Target: 0 incidents per quarter).
- Compliance rate of encryption settings on wireless access points (Target: 100%).

## 7. Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted in exceptional circumstances, provided they do not compromise security. Requests for exceptions must be submitted in writing to the IT Security Team and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Approved exceptions will be documented and monitored for compliance.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
Evidence and logs related to wireless access must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**. This policy shall be reviewed and updated **at least annually** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness in addressing emerging threats and changes in technology.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy during the initial training and at annual training refreshers. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to wireless access management, including approvals, configuration changes, and access attempts.
