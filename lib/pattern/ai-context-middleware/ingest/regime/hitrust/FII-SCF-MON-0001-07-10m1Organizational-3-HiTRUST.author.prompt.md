You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "07.10m1Organizational.3" (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0001). 

The policy document must follow this structure without including References subsections within individual sections. Each section should be clearly defined with H2 headings (##) and must include the following components:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the purpose and importance of the policy regarding vulnerability management.
   
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to proactively scanning information systems for technical vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance with HiTRUST requirements.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope, covering all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels for creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Outline specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role involved in the vulnerability management process, including but not limited to IT Security and Compliance Officers.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement for periodic scanning of information systems.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Utilize automated tools to conduct vulnerability scans on a quarterly basis and ingest results into Surveilr.").
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify the actions a human must take (e.g., "The IT Security Manager must sign off on the quarterly vulnerability assessment report, which is then uploaded to Surveilr with metadata.").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to defined KPIs/SLAs (e.g., "All vulnerabilities must be remediated within 30 days of identification.").

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for requesting them.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., "All vulnerability scan reports must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.") and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging of all critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.

10. **References**: This section must be the final section of the document and contain only external references in the format [Link Text](URL) or indicate "None" if no references exist. 

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes SMART, actionable instructions, and emphasizes the importance of documented evidence collection and verification methods. The policy must conclude with exactly ONE References section, with no additional content following it.
