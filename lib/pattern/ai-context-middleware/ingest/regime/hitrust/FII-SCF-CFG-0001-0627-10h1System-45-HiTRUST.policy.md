# Vendor-Supplied Software and System Configuration Policy

## Introduction
This policy establishes guidelines for the maintenance of vendor-supplied software and system configurations within our organization. It aims to ensure that all operational systems are supported by their suppliers and utilize the latest versions of web browsers, thereby leveraging enhanced security features. The policy also outlines the necessity for maintaining a current baseline configuration of information systems and configuring security parameters to mitigate risks of misuse.

## Policy Statement
It is the intent of this policy to enforce the consistent maintenance of vendor-supplied software and system configurations across all operational environments. The organization commits to regularly updating software, ensuring compliance with supplier support timelines, and adhering to established baseline configurations to protect against vulnerabilities.

## Scope
This policy applies to all:
- Organizational entities
- Operational environments
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems

## Responsibilities
- **IT Administrators**: **Monitor** vendor software updates **monthly**; **Implement** configuration changes **as needed**.
- **Compliance Officers**: **Review** policy compliance **quarterly**; **Report** discrepancies **immediately**.
- **System Owners**: **Validate** software versions and configurations **bi-annually**; **Document** findings in Surveilr.
- **Security Team**: **Conduct** vulnerability assessments **semi-annually**; **Remediate** identified risks **immediately**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: All vendor-supplied software must be maintained at supported versions, and system configurations must align with established baselines.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize OSquery for automated checks of software versions and configurations. Integrate with APIs for real-time validation of compliance against vendor specifications.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: System Owners must submit a signed attestation form quarterly, detailing software versions and configuration settings. All attestation forms will be ingested into Surveilr for tracking and auditing purposes.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 100% of operational systems must be running supported vendor software versions.
- Baseline configurations must be verified with a compliance rate of 95% or higher during audits.
- Any discrepancies in software versions must be resolved within 30 days of identification.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Any exceptions must include a risk assessment and a mitigation strategy to manage potential impacts.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs related to software configurations and attestation must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to assess its relevance and effectiveness, ensuring it meets current operational and compliance needs.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to this policy upon implementation and during each **Annual Review**. Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained, and formal documentation for any exceptions will be required and stored in Surveilr.
