## Introduction

The purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive framework for vulnerability management within the organization. Effective vulnerability management is vital for safeguarding sensitive electronic protected health information (ePHI) and ensuring compliance with HiTRUST requirements. By proactively identifying and remediating vulnerabilities in information systems, the organization mitigates risks associated with potential security breaches and enhances its overall security posture.

## Policy Statement

The organization is committed to a proactive approach to vulnerability management. This includes conducting regular scans of all information systems to identify and address technical vulnerabilities, thereby ensuring compliance with HiTRUST requirements. The organization will implement appropriate measures to manage vulnerabilities effectively and safeguard sensitive information.

## Scope

This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels for creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting ePHI

The scope encompasses all systems and personnel involved in the management and protection of ePHI.

## Responsibilities

- **IT Security Team**: Conduct vulnerability scans on a quarterly basis and analyze scan results for remediation actions.
- **Compliance Officer**: Ensure that vulnerability management practices align with HiTRUST requirements, conducting annual policy reviews.
- **IT Security Manager**: Review and approve the quarterly vulnerability assessment report and ensure it is documented in Surveilr.
- **System Administrators**: Remediate identified vulnerabilities within 30 days of detection and document the remediation actions taken.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must conduct periodic scans of information systems at least annually to identify technical vulnerabilities.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize automated tools to conduct vulnerability scans on a quarterly basis and ingest results into Surveilr.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The IT Security Manager must sign off on the quarterly vulnerability assessment report, which is then uploaded to Surveilr with relevant metadata.

## Verification Criteria

To validate compliance with this policy, the following criteria must be met:
- All vulnerabilities identified during scans must be remediated within 30 days of identification.
- Quarterly scanning reports must be generated and reviewed by the IT Security Team.
- Annual policy reviews must be completed and documented.

## Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be formally requested in writing to the Compliance Officer. The request must include a justification for the exception and a proposed alternative measure to mitigate associated risks. All approved exceptions will be documented and reviewed annually.

## Lifecycle Requirements

- **Data Retention**: All vulnerability scan reports must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy must undergo an annual review to ensure its continued relevance and compliance with HiTRUST requirements.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

All workforce members involved in the vulnerability management process must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs of all critical actions must be maintained, and formal documentation of any exceptions must be recorded and reviewed.
