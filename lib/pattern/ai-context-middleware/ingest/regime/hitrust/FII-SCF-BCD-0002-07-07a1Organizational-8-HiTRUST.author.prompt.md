You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 07.07a1Organizational.8 (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0002). 

## Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**
   - Provide an overview of the policy purpose and its importance in maintaining organizational inventories of IT assets.

2. **Policy Statement**
   - Clearly state the organization's commitment to periodically reviewing IT asset inventories for completeness and accuracy.

3. **Scope**
   - Define the scope of the policy to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**
   - Outline specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review). Link to related organizational plans as necessary.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**
   - Use numbered subheadings for each requirement:
     1. **REQUIREMENT:** Explain the control requirement.
     2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
     3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Describe specific actions, artifacts, and documentation methods (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report and uploads it to Surveilr with metadata").

6. **Verification Criteria**
   - Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the **SMART** objectives and **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the policy.

7. **Exceptions**
   - Detail any exceptions to the policy, including justification, duration, and approval documentation.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**
   - Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**
   - Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **Final Section Requirements**
    - Ensure the **References** section is the final section of the policy document, without any References subsections in individual policy sections.

**Important Note:** Ensure that all keywords are explicitly used and **BOLD**: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. Failure to do so results in critical non-compliance.

### References
- Ensure to end the policy document with exactly ONE References section in the format: 

The generated policy must maximize machine attestability, include clear operational detail and specificity, and follow the outlined structure strictly.
