You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 0502.09m1Organizational.5 (FII: FII-SCF-NET-0001). 

The policy must follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and its importance for wireless security.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to ensuring that wireless access is explicitly approved and that all wireless access points and devices utilize appropriate encryption.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, ensuring it includes all relevant entities, environments, and systems, including cloud-hosted systems and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify the roles involved in the policy enforcement, detailing specific, task-level duties (Action Verb + Frequency) for each role.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. **REQUIREMENT**: Outline the requirement for wireless access approval and encryption.
   - 2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe how machine evidence can be collected and verified, such as using automated tools to ensure that only approved devices are connected and that encryption protocols like AES WPA2 are in use.
   - 3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Provide specific actions for human verification, such as requiring a signed document from an IT manager certifying that all wireless access points have been reviewed and approved.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly linked to the defined KPIs/SLAs.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for requesting them.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, and establish comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

10. **References**: Provide a single, consolidated References section at the end of the policy document, ensuring that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections. 

Ensure that all sections maximize machine attestability and include explicit human attestation methods where necessary. The policy must adhere strictly to the specified format and content requirements, including the use of **SMART** criteria, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

Do not include SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code. The document must conclude with exactly ONE References section.
