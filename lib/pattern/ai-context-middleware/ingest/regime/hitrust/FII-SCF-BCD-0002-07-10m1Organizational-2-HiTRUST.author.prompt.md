You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 07.10m1Organizational (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0002). 

The policy document must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Each section should include:

1. **Introduction**: Clearly define the purpose of the policy and its importance in maintaining security through automated and manual software updates.

2. **Policy Statement**: Articulate the organization's commitment to deploying automated software update tools and the processes for systems that require manual updates.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned using **Action Verb + Frequency** (e.g., "IT Security: daily review of update logs"). Include explicit links to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Describe the requirement for automated software updates. 
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest methods for collecting evidence, such as using API integrations with software vendors to validate update installations.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Specify actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr, such as a manager certifying quarterly that all systems are updated.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** KPIs/SLAs defined in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions to the policy, including justification and approval requirements.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update** (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

The policy must prioritize machine attestability, ensuring each requirement includes concrete examples for automated evidence collection and validation. In cases where human attestation is necessary, define exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.

The document must use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code, and must not include References subsections within individual policy sections. The **References** section should only appear at the very end of the document.

Ensure that the policy document incorporates and **BOLDs** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

At the conclusion of the policy document, provide exactly ONE **References** section formatted as [Link Text](URL) if external references exist, or "None" if there are no external references. 

Adhere strictly to these instructions to ensure a 100% compliance score.
