You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 04.01x1Organizational (FII: FII-SCF-CPL-0002).

**Instructions for Policy Authoring:**

1. **Document Structure**: Follow the exact policy section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

2. **Policy Sections**: Each section must include:
   - An explanation of the control requirement.
   - Machine attestation methods, using practical, automatable techniques (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect mobile device inventory daily").
   - Human attestation methods, when automation is impractical, specifying exact actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the annual mobile device encryption report, uploaded to Surveilr with metadata").

3. **SMART Goals**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like containment or correction, include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** and a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

4. **Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems**, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

5. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

6. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when human attestation is necessary.

7. **Roles and Responsibilities**: In the Responsibilities section, define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, linking to or referencing related organizational plans for escalation and recovery actions.

8. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: State requirements for **Workforce member acknowledgment/attestation** of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.

10. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Structure using numbered subheadings: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

11. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

12. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

13. **Hyperlinks**: Use the format [Link Text](URL) for external references.

14. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the end, containing no other content.

15. **Keyword Emphasis**: Bold the following keywords explicitly: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

16. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document**. After this section, output nothing else.
