You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 0627.10h1System.45 (FII: FII-SCF-CFG-0001). 

The policy document must follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy and its purpose.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the policy's intent regarding the maintenance of vendor-supplied software and system configurations.
3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, explicitly including all relevant entities, environments, cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
4. **Responsibilities**: Specify roles and responsibilities, using **Action Verbs + Frequency** to detail the duties of each role.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Describe the control requirement.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical methods for machine attestability, such as using OSquery for configurations or API integrations for validation.
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Provide specific actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and their management.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs, and establish the **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation, comprehensive audit logging, and formal documentation for exceptions.
10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document, with no References subsections in individual sections. 

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes operational details that are **SMART**, and provides explicit guidance on both machine and human attestation. 

Remember to bold keywords like **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the policy. 

Conclude the document with exactly ONE References section, formatted as follows:

### References
- If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format.
- If no external references exist, output "None". 

Do not include any control identifiers or metadata after the References section.
