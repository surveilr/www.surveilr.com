# Policy Document for Control: Restriction of Writable and Removable Media

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the restriction of writable, removable media and personally owned, removable media within organizational systems. This policy aims to protect sensitive organizational data, including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), from unauthorized access and potential breaches.

## Policy Statement
The organization strictly prohibits the use of writable, removable media and personally owned, removable media on all organizational systems to prevent data exfiltration and unauthorized data access. All personnel must adhere to this policy and use approved methods for data transfer and storage.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities, including:
- On-premises systems
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - **Monitor** compliance with the policy **Monthly**
  - **Review** access logs for removable media **Weekly**
  
- **All Employees**: 
  - **Comply** with this policy **Always**
  - **Report** any incidents of policy violations **Immediately**
  
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - **Audit** policy adherence **Quarterly**
  - **Update** policy documentation **Annually**

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT:** Prohibition of writable and removable media usage
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** 
     - Utilize OSQuery to monitor connected devices and generate reports on removable media usage.
     - Implement API integrations with endpoint protection solutions to log and alert any unauthorized media access attempts.

   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** 
     - Employees must complete a training acknowledgment form that confirms understanding of the policy.
     - Document incidents through a standardized incident report template and submit it to the IT Security Team.

2. **REQUIREMENT:** Regular monitoring of compliance
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** 
     - Set up automated alerts for any writable media detected on organizational systems.
     - Collect logs from endpoint protection solutions for monthly review.

   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** 
     - Conduct monthly reviews of compliance logs by the IT Security Team and document findings in a compliance report.

## Verification Criteria
- Compliance will be measured by the percentage of systems without unauthorized removable media detected. The target is **100% compliance** as verified through monthly audits.
- Incident reports should be logged and responded to within **24 hours** of detection, with a resolution documented within **72 hours**.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. All exceptions will require formal documentation and will be subject to an **Annual Review** to assess necessity and risks.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- All evidence and logs must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through a documented sign-off. Comprehensive audit logging must be maintained for all critical actions related to removable media access, and formal documentation must be created for all exceptions.
