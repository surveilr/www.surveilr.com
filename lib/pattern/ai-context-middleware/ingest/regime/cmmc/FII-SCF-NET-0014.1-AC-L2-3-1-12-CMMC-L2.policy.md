## Remote Access Session Management Policy

### Introduction
This policy establishes the framework for the management of remote access sessions within the organization. Its purpose is to ensure that all remote access to sensitive information is monitored and controlled through automated mechanisms. This is crucial in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information systems, particularly in the context of increasing cyber threats and the need for compliance with regulatory standards such as the CMMC.

### Policy Statement
The organization is committed to using automated mechanisms to effectively monitor and control remote access sessions. This policy mandates the implementation of these mechanisms to ensure the security of sensitive information and to maintain compliance with applicable standards, including CMMC requirements.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to the organizationâ€™s information systems. It encompasses all environments where sensitive information is created, received, maintained, or transmitted, including but not limited to:

- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used for remote access

### Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: **Monitor** remote access logs **daily** to identify unauthorized access attempts.
- **System Administrators**: **Configure** automated monitoring tools **monthly** to ensure they are functioning as intended.
- **Compliance Officer**: **Review** access control policies **annually** for compliance with organizational standards and regulatory requirements.
- **All Users**: **Report** suspected unauthorized access **immediately** to the IT Security Team.

### Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must utilize automated mechanisms to monitor and control remote access sessions effectively.
  
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
   - Implement OSquery to continuously monitor remote access logs, generating alerts for any anomalies in real-time.
   - Schedule automated reports that summarize remote access activities on a **weekly basis**, providing insights into access patterns and potential threats.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
   - Conduct quarterly training sessions for users on recognizing security incidents, with documentation of attendance and assessments.
   - Maintain logs of manual reviews of remote access sessions conducted by the IT Security Team, including date, time, and findings.

### Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 100% of remote access logs must be monitored and reported on a **weekly basis**.
- Automated monitoring tools must have an uptime of at least 99% over a **monthly period**.
- Annual audits must confirm that 100% of all access control policies are reviewed.

### Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Documentation should include the reason for the exception, the duration, and any compensating controls put in place to mitigate risk.

### Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence collected must be retained for a minimum of **two years** to comply with regulatory requirements.
- **Annual Review**: This policy must be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

### Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding of this policy through a formal sign-off process during onboarding and annually thereafter. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for critical actions, and any exceptions documented must be formally reviewed by the Compliance Officer.
