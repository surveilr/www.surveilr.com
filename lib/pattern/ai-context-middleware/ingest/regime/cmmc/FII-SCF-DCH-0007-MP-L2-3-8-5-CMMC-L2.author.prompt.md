You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "MP.L2-3.8.5" (FII: FII-SCF-DCH-0007). 

The policy document must follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the purpose of the policy and its importance in protecting digital and non-digital media during transport.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organizationâ€™s commitment to protecting and controlling media during transport outside of controlled areas.

3. **Scope**: Define the comprehensive scope of the policy, including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify granular roles and task-level duties with **Action Verb + Frequency** for each role involved in the policy implementation.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the specific requirement for protecting and controlling media during transport.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automated methods for evidence collection, such as using tracking systems to log movements of media and verifying secure transport protocols.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Provide verifiable actions that humans must perform, including documentation requirements for transport logs and certifications of secure handling.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, tying these directly to the **SMART** KPIs/SLAs defined earlier in the document.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the process for documenting and approving these exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: End the policy document with exactly ONE References section. Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections; they should only appear at the document end.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by providing concrete examples of automated evidence collection and validation, and clearly defines the human attestation processes where necessary. Highlight and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the policy.
