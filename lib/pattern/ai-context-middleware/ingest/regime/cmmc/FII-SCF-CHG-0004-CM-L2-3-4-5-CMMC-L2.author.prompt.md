You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "CM.L2-3.4.5" (FII: FII-SCF-CHG-0004). 

The policy must follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy and its importance in enforcing configuration restrictions to prevent unauthorized changes.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to enforcing configuration restrictions.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in enforcing this policy, such as the Compliance Officer and IT Security personnel.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the control requirement regarding configuration restrictions.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using OSquery to collect configuration data.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Provide specific actions and artifacts for human verification, such as a manager signing off on configuration audits.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the process for documenting these exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a single section at the end of the document for references, formatted as [Link Text](URL). 

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by including attestation guidance in every section. Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections; they should only appear in the final References section. Emphasize the use of **SMART** instructions, **KPIs/SLAs**, and ensure that all enforced keywords are **BOLD**.
