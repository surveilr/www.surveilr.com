You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: MP.L2-3.8.9 (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0011). 

The policy document must follow this structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Each section must be clearly defined with H2 headings (##). 

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance in ensuring data availability through backups.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to creating recurring backups of data, software, and system images, and verifying their integrity.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's applicability to all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify task-level duties for each role involved in the backup process, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format (e.g., "IT Security: daily verification of backup integrity").

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings for each requirement:
     - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Describe the backup and verification requirements.
     - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Use automated scripts to verify backup integrity weekly").
     - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Define specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the monthly backup report").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting any exceptions to the policy.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., "retain for 6 years") and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., "reviewed at least **annually**").

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance for each requirement. Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code. Do not include References subsections within policy sections; the document must end with exactly ONE References section. 

The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.
