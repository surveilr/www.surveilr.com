# Continuous Monitoring of Communications Traffic Policy

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the continuous monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic within the organization. This monitoring aims to identify unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions that may compromise the security of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). By implementing proactive measures, we strive to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of sensitive information.

## 2. Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to maintaining a robust security posture through continuous monitoring of communications traffic. We recognize the critical importance of compliance with CMMC Control SI.L2-3.14.6 and the relevant FII identifiers, including FII-SCF-MON-0001.3. This commitment ensures that we remain vigilant against potential threats and uphold our responsibilities concerning the protection of ePHI.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all communications traffic associated with the organization, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officers**: Monitor compliance with this policy and report findings to the executive team **monthly**.
- **IT Security Personnel**: Conduct continuous monitoring and analysis of traffic logs **daily**, ensuring prompt identification of anomalies.
- **Cybersecurity Manager**: Review and sign monthly traffic analysis reports, ensuring documentation is ingested into Surveilr **monthly**.
- **All Workforce Members**: Acknowledge understanding and compliance with this policy **annually**.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT
Continuous monitoring of communications traffic is required to detect unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions that may impact the security of ePHI.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION
To ensure machine attestability, automated tools will be employed to analyze traffic logs and detect anomalies. For example, "Ingest traffic monitoring logs into Surveilr daily for anomaly detection," allowing for effective oversight and rapid response to potential threats.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION
The cybersecurity manager is responsible for reviewing and signing monthly traffic analysis reports. These reports will be documented, and the signed copies will be ingested into Surveilr to maintain a record of human oversight.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be established through the following SMART metrics and KPIs/SLAs:
- **Specific**: Achieve a 98% detection rate of anomalies in communications traffic.
- **Measurable**: Document and review at least 12 traffic analysis reports annually.
- **Achievable**: Ensure that at least 90% of anomalies identified are resolved within 24 hours.
- **Relevant**: Maintain compliance with CMMC Control SI.L2-3.14.6 and FII-SCF-MON-0001.3.
- **Time-bound**: Complete monthly reports and reviews within 5 business days of the end of each month.

## 7. Exceptions
Permissible exceptions to this policy may be granted under certain circumstances. Any exceptions must be documented and approved by the IT Security Manager. Documentation must include the rationale for the exception and be submitted for review to the compliance committee.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs related to communications traffic monitoring must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy shall be reviewed and updated annually to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members are required to acknowledge and attest to their understanding of and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions, including documentation for all exceptions granted under this policy.
