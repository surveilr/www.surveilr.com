# CMMC Compliance Policy for Control: MP.L2-3.8.9

## Introduction
This policy outlines the organization's commitment to ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of backup information through the use of cryptographic mechanisms. It is essential for maintaining Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BCDR) by preventing unauthorized disclosure and modification of critical data. The implementation of this policy is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to utilizing cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and/or modification of backup information. All backup data must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols to ensure its confidentiality and integrity.

## Scope
This policy applies to all entities and environments within the organization, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit backup information

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security**: 
  - **Implement** encryption protocols for backup data **(Quarterly)**
  - **Monitor** compliance with encryption standards **(Monthly)**

- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - **Review** encryption policies and practices **(Annually)**
  - **Report** compliance status to management **(Quarterly)**

- **Backup Administrator**: 
  - **Verify** encryption status of backup files **(Weekly)**
  - **Document** any discrepancies in encryption **(As needed)**

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: All backup information must be encrypted using approved cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
   - Utilize automated tools to verify the encryption status of backup files. These tools should generate reports indicating whether backups are encrypted and compliant with the established standards.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
   - A designated manager must sign off on encryption verification reports to confirm that all backup information is adequately protected.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- **Encryption Verification Rate**: 100% of backup files must be verified as encrypted.
- **Report Submission Timeliness**: 100% of encryption verification reports must be submitted within the specified timeframes.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented, including:
- Justification for the exception
- Approval from the Compliance Officer
- A plan for mitigating risks associated with the exception

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs related to encryption must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging must be maintained for all critical actions related to backup encryption, and formal documentation must be created for all exceptions.
