## Introduction

This policy establishes the requirements for utilizing antimalware technologies to detect and eradicate malicious code within the organization, in compliance with CMMC control SI.L1-3.14.2. The purpose of this document is to outline the procedures and responsibilities necessary to ensure effective endpoint security across all environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems that handle sensitive data.

## Policy Statement

The organization shall implement and maintain robust antimalware technologies to actively monitor, detect, and eliminate malicious code across all relevant systems. The effectiveness of these technologies will be validated through **SMART** objectives that are measurable and actionable, ensuring adherence to industry best practices and compliance requirements.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors accessing or managing systems that store, process, or transmit sensitive data. It encompasses:

- All cloud-hosted systems.
- SaaS applications utilized by the organization.
- Third-party vendor systems.
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data.

## Responsibilities

- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for implementing and maintaining antimalware solutions, as well as conducting regular assessments of their effectiveness.
- **IT Manager**: Responsible for ensuring compliance with this policy and signing off on validation reports.
- **All Employees**: Required to report any suspected malware incidents immediately to the IT Security Team.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### Machine Attestation

- **Use OSquery** to collect antimalware status on endpoints **weekly**.
- **Automate** the generation of logs from antimalware solutions to capture detection and remediation activities.
- Schedule **daily scans** of all critical systems and record the outcomes in the centralized logging system.

### Human Attestation

- The **IT Manager** must sign the **monthly antimalware validation report**, which documents the effectiveness of the antimalware technology and any incidents of malicious code detected and remediated. This report will be uploaded to Surveilr.
- Conduct **quarterly training** sessions for employees on recognizing and reporting malware threats, with attendance logs submitted to Surveilr for record-keeping.

## Verification Criteria

- Compliance will be measured based on the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
  - At least **95%** of endpoints should have current antimalware signatures updated within the past **24 hours**.
  - **Monthly** reports must be generated, reviewed, and signed by the IT Manager within **5 business days** of the end of each month.
  - All detected malware incidents must be remediated within **72 hours** of detection.

## Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the IT Security Team. Exceptions will be logged and reviewed during the **Annual Review** process to assess ongoing relevance and adherence to security standards.

## Lifecycle Requirements

- **Data Retention**: Evidence of antimalware activities, including logs and reports, must be retained for a minimum of **2 years**.
- Policy reviews will occur **annually** to ensure relevance and compliance with evolving security landscapes.
- Updates to this policy shall be conducted as necessary to reflect significant changes in technology or threats.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

- All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy, documented through a signed attestation form.
- Comprehensive audit logging will track all critical actions related to antimalware operations, including installations, updates, detections, and remediations.
- Any exceptions must be formally documented and reviewed by the IT Security Team.
