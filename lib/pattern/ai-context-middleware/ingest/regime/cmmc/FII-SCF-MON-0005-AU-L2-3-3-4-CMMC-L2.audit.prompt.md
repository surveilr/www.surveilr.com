You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

- **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
- **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
  - **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
  - **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
  - **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
- **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
  - **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
  - **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
  - **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
- **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

- **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
- **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization alerts appropriate personnel in the event of a log processing failure and takes actions to remedy the disruption."
  - **Control Code:** AU.L2-3.3.4
  - **Control Question:** Does the organization alert appropriate personnel in the event of a log processing failure and take actions to remedy the disruption?
  - **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-MON-0005
- **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
  "This policy establishes the framework for alerting appropriate personnel in the event of a log processing failure. The organization is committed to alerting designated personnel immediately upon detection of such failures and mandates timely actions to remedy any disruptions to ensure continuous monitoring and compliance."
- **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "1. Automated alerts configured within the monitoring system that notify the IT Security Team of log processing failures. 2. Incident logs documenting the response actions taken for each failure, including timestamps and personnel involved. 3. Monthly review reports indicating adherence to the documentation requirements and incident resolution timelines."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AU.L2-3.3.4

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** AU.L2-3.3.4
**Control Question:** Does the organization alert appropriate personnel in the event of a log processing failure and take actions to remedy the disruption?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-MON-0005
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization alerts appropriate personnel in the event of a log processing failure and takes actions to remedy the disruption.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must alert appropriate personnel when a log processing failure occurs, ensuring timely remediation actions.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated alerts configured within the monitoring system that notify the IT Security Team of log processing failures.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Integration with monitoring systems via API calls to capture alerts automatically.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM logs WHERE event_type = 'log_processing_failure' AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE;
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided automated alerts demonstrate that the organization is capable of notifying personnel as required by the control.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Documentation of response actions taken for each failure, including timestamps and personnel involved.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Incident logs documenting the response actions taken for each failure.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Captured logs via file ingestion and monitored directly from the system's incident response tool.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM incident_logs WHERE action_taken = 'remediation' AND incident_type = 'log_processing_failure';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The incident logs provide thorough records demonstrating compliance with the documentation and response requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Personnel must document actions taken in response to alerts, including timestamps and resolution details.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Monthly review reports indicating adherence to the documentation requirements and incident resolution timelines.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Documentation of human responses to alerts.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Surveilr records the act of human attestation through stored monthly review reports.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The monthly reports confirm that personnel are documenting their actions in accordance with the policy requirements.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** Based on the totality of the provided evidence, it genuinely demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The evidence shows timely alerts and documented responses, fulfilling both the literal requirements and the spirit of ensuring operational integrity.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None identified.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit revealed that the organization has effectively implemented and maintained a system for alerting personnel about log processing failures, with appropriate documentation of actions taken, thereby meeting the control's requirements and intent.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [If applicable, detail any specific pieces of evidence that are missing.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [If applicable, specify why any provided evidence is non-compliant and what specific correction is required.]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [If applicable, list precise steps a human auditor or compliance officer needs to take.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [If applicable, outline the process for re-submission of the corrected/missing evidence for re-evaluation.]
