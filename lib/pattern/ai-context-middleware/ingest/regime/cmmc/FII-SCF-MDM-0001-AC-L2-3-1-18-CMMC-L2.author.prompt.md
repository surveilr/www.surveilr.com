You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "AC.L2-3.1.18" (FII: "FII-SCF-MDM-0001"). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

1. **Introduction**: Clearly explain the purpose of the policy regarding Mobile Device Management (MDM) controls.
  
2. **Policy Statement**: Define the organizationâ€™s stance on implementing and governing MDM controls, ensuring clarity and robustness.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Outline specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, ensuring clarity and accountability.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Structure this section with numbered subheadings for each requirement as follows:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, focusing on how machine evidence would realistically be collected and verified.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Provide specific, verifiable actions a human must perform, detailing the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Include clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** instructions and **KPIs/SLAs** defined earlier.

7. **Exceptions**: Define the process for managing exceptions to the policy.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs, and mandatory frequency for policy review and update, ensuring **Annual Review**.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by including attestation guidance in each section. Each policy section must be clear, robust, and actionable, with a bulleted list of **3-5 operational steps** for processes like containment or correction, including specific time-bound metrics (KPIs/SLAs). 

Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections; the References section should only appear at the very end of the document. Emphasize and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the policy.
