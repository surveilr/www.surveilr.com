You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: SC.L2-3.13.14 (FII: FII-SCF-NET-0013).

### Policy Structure
1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy and its purpose related to the protection of electronic messaging communications.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic messaging communications.
3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope, including all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
4. **Responsibilities**: Specify task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in policy implementation and compliance.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Structure this section with the following:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, emphasizing how Surveilr will validate compliance.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Outline precise actions, artifacts, and methods for documentation and ingestion into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **SMART** **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Define any exceptions to the policy, including documentation requirements.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging, and formal documentation for exceptions.
10. **References**: Conclude the document with a single References section at the very end, formatted as follows: 
   - If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format.
   - If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

### Important Guidelines
- Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections. The References section should appear ONLY at the very end of the document.
- Ensure that all sections maximize machine attestability and provide detailed attestation guidance.
- Use **bold text** for enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. Failure to bold any keyword will result in a critical non-compliance error.
