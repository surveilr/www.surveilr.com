You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PE.L2-3.10.2 (FII: FII-SCF-PES-0005). 

## Policy Structure
1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the importance of monitoring, detecting, and responding to physical security incidents.
2. **Policy Statement**: State the organization's commitment to maintaining physical security and compliance.
3. **Scope**: Clearly define the scope of the policy to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.
4. **Responsibilities**: Detail the specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in monitoring and responding to physical security incidents.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement for monitoring physical security incidents.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automated methods for evidence collection, such as using surveillance systems and access control logs.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Outline specific actions that must be taken by personnel, including documentation procedures.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Define clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs** established in the policy.
7. **Exceptions**: State the process for documenting any exceptions to the policy.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include data retention periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (**Annual Review**).
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
10. **References**: This section should be the final section of the policy document. Provide a single list of external references using the format [Link Text](URL). 

### Important Instructions
- Do NOT include References subsections within individual policy sections. 
- Ensure that every section emphasizes **SMART** instructions, and bold the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.
- End the policy document with exactly ONE References section and no additional content.

Your output must follow these guidelines strictly, ensuring comprehensive policy coverage that maximizes machine attestability and meets compliance requirements.
