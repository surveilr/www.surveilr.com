# CMMC Compliance Policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.5

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements for the inventory and validation of all privileged accounts within the organization. It ensures that each individual with elevated privileges is authorized by the appropriate level of management, thereby enhancing the security posture and compliance with CMMC requirements.

## Policy Statement
The organization shall maintain a comprehensive inventory of all privileged accounts. Each account shall be validated to ensure that the assigned user has the appropriate authorization from management. This policy aims to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors with access to privileged accounts.
- All systems and applications, including on-premises, cloud-hosted environments, and Software as a Service (SaaS) applications.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Conduct inventory checks of privileged accounts **quarterly**; ensure compliance with policy requirements and maintain documentation.
- **System Administrators**: Validate privileged account authorizations and update the inventory **monthly**.
- **Management**: Review and approve all privileged access requests and authorizations **annually**.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT:
Inventory all privileged accounts and validate authorization.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
- Utilize automated tools to generate reports on privileged account inventories from Active Directory and cloud service providers (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure AD) on a **monthly** basis.
- Implement logging mechanisms to track changes in privileged account status and authorizations in real-time.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
- System Administrators must review the generated reports and confirm the accuracy of privileged account listings by signing and submitting a validation report into Surveilr.
- Management must sign off on the authorization of each privileged user, with artifacts stored in Surveilr for audit purposes.

## Verification Criteria
- The organization must achieve a **100%** completion rate for the inventory of privileged accounts and their validation as evidenced by machine-generated reports and human validation artifacts.
- Compliance will be evaluated against **KPIs/SLAs** defined as follows:
  - 100% of privileged accounts must be reviewed and validated **monthly**.
  - Management authorization for new privileged accounts must be completed within **5 business days** of request.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the IT Security Team, with formal acknowledgment from management. These exceptions will be tracked and reviewed during the **Annual Review**.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to privileged account inventory and validation must be retained for a minimum of **3 years**.
- **Policy Review**: This policy shall be reviewed and updated **annually**, or sooner if significant changes occur in organizational structure or regulatory requirements.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding of this policy through attestation in Surveilr.
- An audit log must be maintained for critical actions related to privileged account changes, including creation, modification, and deletion.
- All exceptions must be formally documented and logged for audit purposes.
