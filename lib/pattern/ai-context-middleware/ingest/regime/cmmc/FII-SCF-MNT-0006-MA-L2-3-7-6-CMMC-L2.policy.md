# CMMC Compliance Policy Document for Control: MA.L2-3.7.6 (FII: FII-SCF-MNT-0006)

## 1. Introduction
This policy outlines the procedures for maintaining a current list of authorized maintenance organizations or personnel. It is crucial for ensuring the integrity and security of our systems, particularly those handling electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). Keeping an updated list mitigates risks associated with unauthorized access and potential breaches, thereby enhancing our compliance posture and safeguarding sensitive data.

## 2. Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to maintaining an updated list of authorized maintenance organizations and personnel. This policy ensures that only vetted and approved entities have access to our systems for maintenance purposes, thereby promoting trust and compliance with industry standards.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all maintenance organizations and personnel involved in maintaining systems that create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. This includes:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)
- Any channels utilized for data processing and maintenance activities

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Quarterly policy approval; ensure that the authorized maintenance list is reviewed and updated.
- **IT Security**: Daily log review; monitor access logs to validate authorized maintenance activities.
- **System Administrator**: Monthly maintenance personnel validation; ensure that all personnel listed are current and have undergone necessary vetting.
- **HR Department**: As needed; ensure that personnel records are up-to-date for all maintenance personnel.

Each role must actively refer to and integrate actions from the Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, and Sanction Policy to address any compliance gaps.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
- **1. REQUIREMENT**: The organization must maintain a current list of authorized maintenance organizations or personnel.
- **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Use OSquery to collect and validate a list of authorized maintenance personnel daily, ensuring that only those on the list are able to access maintenance functions.
- **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The IT manager must sign off on quarterly reviews of the authorized maintenance personnel list. The signed report must be uploaded to Surveilr with metadata including review date and reviewer name.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be measured through the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- **KPI 1**: 100% of authorized maintenance personnel lists updated within a 30-day window after any personnel change.
- **KPI 2**: 100% of quarterly reviews completed and documented in Surveilr by the deadline.
- **SLA**: All access logs must show that maintenance activities are performed exclusively by authorized individuals.

## 7. Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted only under extraordinary circumstances, such as emergency repairs where immediate action is necessary. Any exceptions must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer and relevant stakeholders.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs related to maintenance personnel must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy must be reviewed at least annually to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to understanding and complying with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions, including updates to the authorized maintenance list. Any exceptions must have formal documentation including justification, duration, and approval from the designated authority.
