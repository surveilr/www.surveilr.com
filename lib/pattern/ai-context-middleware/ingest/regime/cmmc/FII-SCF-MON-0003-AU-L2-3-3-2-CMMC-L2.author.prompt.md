You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AU.L2-3.3.2 (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0003). 

The policy must be structured as follows:

## Introduction
- Provide a clear overview of the policy's purpose and importance in relation to event logging.

## Policy Statement
- State the commitment to configure systems to produce comprehensive event logs.

## Scope
- Define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit data.

## Responsibilities
- Clearly outline specific duties for each role involved in the policy implementation. Use **Action Verbs + Frequency** to define responsibilities.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:** Describe the requirement to produce event logs with sufficient information.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest automated methods such as collecting logs using centralized logging solutions, and verifying log completeness through automated tools.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Define the actions a human must perform, such as a manager reviewing logs monthly, and specify the documentation to be uploaded to Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation that are directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the previous section.

## Exceptions
- Outline procedures for documenting exceptions, including justification and approval processes.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Specify **Data Retention** periods for logs and the frequency of policy review and update, emphasizing the need for **Annual Review**.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, and ensure comprehensive audit logging for critical actions.

### References
- List any external references used in the policy document. If none, state "None".

Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections, and the document ends with exactly ONE References section.
