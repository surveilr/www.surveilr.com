You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization protects sensitive/regulated data contained in log files."
Control Code: AU.L2-3.3.8,
Control Question: Does the organization protect sensitive/regulated data contained in log files?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-MON-0003.1
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the protection of sensitive and regulated data contained within log files. In an increasingly digital landscape, safeguarding this data is crucial for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of organizational assets. Effective log file management is essential not only for compliance with regulatory requirements but also for ensuring the trust of stakeholders and the protection of the organization’s reputation. Our organization is committed to protecting sensitive and regulated data within log files through comprehensive monitoring, access controls, and regular audits. We recognize that log files can contain critical information that, if compromised, could lead to significant risks. Therefore, we will implement necessary measures to ensure that this data is adequately safeguarded against unauthorized access, alteration, and disclosure."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Automated log monitoring tools in place, generating alerts for unauthorized access attempts; file integrity monitoring systems tracking changes to log files; quarterly training sessions conducted; compliance acknowledgment forms signed by all personnel; automated log analysis tools flagging anomalies; monthly report documenting findings from log analysis."

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must ensure that sensitive/regulated data in log files is protected against unauthorized access and tampering.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated log monitoring tools are in place, generating alerts for unauthorized access attempts; file integrity monitoring systems track changes to log files.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion from log monitoring tools and file integrity monitoring systems.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM log_monitoring WHERE alert_triggered = TRUE; 
    * **Compliance Status:** [COMPLIANT / NON-COMPLIANT / INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE]
    * **Justification:** [Detailed explanation of why the evidence is compliant, non-compliant, or insufficient, directly correlating the *provided evidence* to the *control requirement*. If non-compliant, specify the exact deviation.]

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Regular review of log files to identify anomalies and potential breaches.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated log analysis tools flag anomalies based on predefined baselines and thresholds; monthly report documenting findings from log analysis.
