# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across the organization. MFA is essential for safeguarding sensitive data and systems by providing an additional layer of security beyond traditional username and password combinations. This policy aims to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access, ensuring that only authenticated users can gain access to critical systems and data.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all remote network access, third-party systems, and non-console access to critical systems. This commitment aims to enhance our security posture, protect sensitive data, and comply with regulatory requirements. All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors accessing our network must utilize MFA as a condition of access.

## Scope
This policy applies to all users and systems accessing the organization's network, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
All users, including employees, contractors, and third-party service providers, must comply with this policy when accessing organizational resources.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Responsible for daily monitoring of MFA compliance, ensuring that all access points are protected by MFA.
- **System Administrators**: Must configure systems to enforce MFA for all relevant access points and report any issues to the IT Security Team.
- **Compliance Officers**: To conduct quarterly audits of MFA implementation and report findings to management.
- **All Users**: Required to enroll in MFA systems and report any access issues to the IT Security Team promptly.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: It is mandatory for all users accessing organizational resources remotely or through third-party systems to utilize MFA.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automated methods for collecting evidence of MFA compliance include:
   - Utilizing API integrations with identity providers to verify MFA status for all users accessing critical systems.
   - Implementing logging mechanisms to track successful and failed MFA attempts.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Human actions to support MFA compliance consist of:
   - The IT Manager must sign off on the quarterly MFA compliance report documenting adherence to this policy.

## Verification Criteria
The organization will establish the following **SMART** criteria for compliance validation:
- All users must demonstrate MFA compliance **100% of the time**, validated on a **monthly** basis. 
- The compliance reports should include metrics such as the percentage of users enrolled and the number of successful MFA authentications.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and require prior approval from the IT Security Team. The exception request should include:
- A detailed justification for the exception.
- The duration for which the exception is requested.
- An action plan for re-establishing compliance.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: MFA logs must be retained for a minimum of **6 years** to ensure accountability and facilitate audits.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **annual review** to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness. The review will assess compliance, identify areas for improvement, and incorporate any changes in regulations or technology.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding of this policy and their obligation to comply with its requirements. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to MFA enforcement, including user access attempts and administrative changes to MFA settings.
