# Technical Configuration Change Control Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for governing technical configuration changes within the organization, ensuring that all changes are systematically managed and documented. This policy aims to maintain the integrity, security, and compliance of our systems, particularly those handling electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). By implementing a structured change control process, we can minimize risks associated with unauthorized or untracked changes.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to governing technical configuration changes through a formalized change management process. All changes to technical configurations must be documented, reviewed, and approved to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and organizational standards. This policy applies to all technical environments and systems that process ePHI.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- All organizational entities involved in the management of technical configurations.
- Cloud-hosted systems and Software as a Service (SaaS) applications.
- Third-party vendor systems that interact with organizational data.
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - **Review** configuration change requests **weekly**.
  - **Ensure** compliance with regulatory standards **continuously**.
  
- **IT Security**: 
  - **Monitor** configuration changes for unauthorized alterations **daily**.
  - **Report** security incidents related to configuration changes **immediately**.

- **Change Management Team**: 
  - **Document** all approved changes **after each change**.
  - **Conduct** quarterly reviews of change logs **quarterly**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must maintain a record of all technical configuration changes.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
   - Use `OSquery` to collect configuration change logs **daily**.
   - Implement automated scripts to verify configuration settings against baseline standards **weekly**.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
   - The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly configuration change review report **quarterly**.
   - Conduct interviews with team members involved in change management to verify adherence to procedures **semi-annually**.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be based on the following **SMART** criteria:
- **Specific**: All configuration changes must be documented and approved.
- **Measurable**: At least 95% of changes must have documented approvals.
- **Achievable**: Compliance with this policy should be attainable with existing resources.
- **Relevant**: The policy must align with organizational goals for security and compliance.
- **Time-bound**: Compliance will be assessed during the **annual review**.

**KPIs/SLAs**:
- Configuration change approval rate.
- Number of unauthorized changes detected.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. The process for approval includes:
- Submission of a formal exception request.
- Review and assessment of the risk associated with the exception.
- Documentation of the decision and rationale.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to configuration changes must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with current regulations.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to configuration changes. Any exceptions must be formally documented and reviewed.
