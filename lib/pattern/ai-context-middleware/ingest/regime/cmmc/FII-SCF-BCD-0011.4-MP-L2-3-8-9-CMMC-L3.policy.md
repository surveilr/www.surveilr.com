# Cryptographic Mechanisms for Backup Information Policy

## Introduction
In today's digital landscape, the protection of sensitive backup information is paramount to maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of organizational data. Cryptographic mechanisms serve as a critical line of defense against unauthorized disclosure and modification, ensuring that backup information remains secure from potential threats. This policy outlines the commitment of our organization to implement robust cryptographic measures to safeguard backup data, thereby supporting our Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery objectives.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to utilizing cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of backup information. All backup data must be encrypted using industry-standard cryptographic algorithms to ensure its confidentiality and integrity throughout its lifecycle.

## Scope
This policy applies to all relevant entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit backup information

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security**: Daily review of backup encryption status.
- **Backup Administrators**: Weekly verification of encryption implementation on backup systems.
- **Compliance Officer**: Monthly audit of cryptographic compliance reports.
- **IT Manager**: Quarterly approval of backup encryption reports.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: All backup information must be encrypted using approved cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and alterations.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Use OSquery to verify encryption status of backup files and generate automated reports.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly backup encryption report, ensuring compliance with this policy.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated based on the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 100% of backup files must be encrypted as verified by automated reports.
- All quarterly reports must be signed off by the IT manager within 5 business days of completion.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. A formal request must be submitted, detailing the rationale for the exception and the proposed duration of the exemption.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to backup encryption must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- This policy must be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging must be maintained for all critical actions related to backup encryption, and formal documentation must be created for all exceptions.
