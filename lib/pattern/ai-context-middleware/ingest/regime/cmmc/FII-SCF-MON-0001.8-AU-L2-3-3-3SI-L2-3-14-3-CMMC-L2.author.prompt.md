You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AU.L2-3.3.3 (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0001.8). 

1. **Document Structure**: Create the policy with the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Do not include References subsections within each section; the References section should only appear at the very end of the document.

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For example, the policy should include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, along with a **specific time-bound metric (KPIs/SLAs)**.

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to encompass all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection and validation methods within each requirement. For instance, suggest using OSquery to collect asset inventories daily.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed)**: Clearly define specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr for human attestations.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: In the Responsibilities section, define specific, task-level duties with action verbs and frequency for each role mentioned. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

9. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use the following mandatory structure for evidence collection methods: 
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: 
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: 
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: 

10. **Verification Criteria**: Include clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

11. **Markdown Formatting**: Utilize standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

12. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for any external references mentioned.

13. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

14. **Final Section Requirements**: The References section must be the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing elseâ€”no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content. 

15. **References Section Format**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

Please ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes thorough attestation guidance for every requirement.
