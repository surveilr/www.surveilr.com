# Mobile Device Encryption Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the use of cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information stored on mobile devices. As mobile devices increasingly become integral to organizational operations, ensuring that sensitive information is adequately protected is paramount.

## Policy Statement
Our organization commits to employing strong encryption mechanisms on all mobile devices to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of data. This includes the use of full-device encryption and, where applicable, container-based encryption solutions.

## Scope
This policy applies to all mobile devices used within the organization, including personal devices that access organizational data, ensuring that all devices adhere to the established encryption standards.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Implement encryption solutions on all mobile devices **Quarterly**.
- **Device Owners**: Ensure that encryption is enabled on their devices **Immediately upon setup**.
- **Compliance Officer**: Review encryption compliance reports **Monthly**.
- **IT Support Staff**: Assist users in enabling encryption on their devices **As needed**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: All mobile devices must employ cryptographic protection to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Use Surveilr to verify that encryption is enabled on all mobile devices by ingesting device compliance reports.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The IT Security Manager must sign off on the quarterly encryption compliance report.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated based on the following **SMART** criteria:
- **Specific**: All mobile devices must have encryption enabled.
- **Measurable**: 100% of devices must show encryption compliance in quarterly reports.
- **Achievable**: Compliance should be maintained without significant technical barriers.
- **Relevant**: Encryption must be relevant to the types of data accessed and stored on mobile devices.
- **Time-bound**: Compliance audits will occur quarterly.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the IT Security Manager. An exception request must include a justification for the deviation from the policy.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Logs and evidence of encryption compliance must be retained for a minimum of three years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its effectiveness and alignment with organizational goals.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding of this policy through documented signatures. Additionally, comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for critical actions related to encryption compliance.
