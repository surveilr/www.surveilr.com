# Cryptographic Protections Policy

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for implementing cryptographic protections that safeguard sensitive data within the organization. By adhering to known public standards and utilizing trusted cryptographic technologies, we aim to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information transmitted and stored across various platforms.

## 2. Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to the robust implementation of cryptographic protections using known public standards and trusted cryptographic technologies. This policy serves to guide all employees and systems in maintaining compliance with CMMC control SC.L2-3.13.11, ensuring that sensitive data is adequately protected from unauthorized access and breaches.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer: Approve policy quarterly** – Ensure that this policy is reviewed and approved on a quarterly basis as part of the organizational compliance plan.
- **IT Security: Review logs daily** – Conduct daily reviews of security logs to monitor the effectiveness of cryptographic protections.
- **Data Owners: Assess risks bi-annually** – Perform risk assessments related to cryptographic measures every six months in accordance with the organization's risk management plan.
- **Training Coordinator: Conduct training annually** – Deliver annual training to all personnel on the importance and implementation of cryptographic protections.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:** The control requires the organization to implement cryptographic protections that are aligned with known public standards, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Automation tools such as OSquery will be utilized to collect evidence of cryptographic configuration compliance across systems, enabling continuous validation.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Employees will document their compliance actions through attestation forms, which will be submitted to Surveilr for ingestion and record-keeping. These artifacts will include training completion certificates and logs of cryptographic key management activities.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated using **SMART** goals, including:
- **Specific:** All sensitive data must be encrypted during transmission and at rest.
- **Measurable:** 100% of systems must be compliant with cryptographic standards by the end of Q4.
- **Achievable:** Compliance shall be verified through automated systems and manual audits.
- **Relevant:** This aligns with the organization’s goal to protect sensitive data.
- **Time-Bound:** Compliance verification will occur quarterly.

**KPIs/SLAs** will include:
- Logs of encryption activity must be reviewed with a 100% completion rate monthly.
- Training participation must achieve at least 90% employee completion rates annually.

## 7. Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented, including:
- Justification for the exception
- Duration for which the exception is granted
- Approval from the Compliance Officer or designated authority

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
Evidence and logs related to cryptographic protections must be retained for a minimum of **Data Retention** periods of three years. This policy will be subject to an **Annual Review** to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members are required to acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs for all critical actions concerning cryptographic protections will be maintained, and formal documentation will be required for any exceptions granted.
