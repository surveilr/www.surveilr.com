You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "SC.L2-3.13.8" (FII: "FII-SCF-CRY-0001.1"). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** 

1. Each section must explain the control requirement and include machine attestation methods that describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection. For example, "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily." Human attestation methods are to be included where automation is impractical, such as "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly software inventory report."

2. The policy must follow a clear structure with numbered subheadings for Evidence Collection Methods: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:". 

3. The policy must incorporate **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** within the text, ensuring these keywords are **BOLD**.

4. Each requirement must provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly linked to the defined KPIs/SLAs.

5. The Responsibilities section must define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned and explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

6. The policy must include a dedicated subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

7. The policy must require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

8. Ensure that the document ends with exactly ONE References section, formatted as ### References, and do not include References subsections within individual policy sections.

Your output must be clear, concise, and strictly adhere to these guidelines to ensure a policy that maximizes machine attestability and achieves a 100% compliance score.
