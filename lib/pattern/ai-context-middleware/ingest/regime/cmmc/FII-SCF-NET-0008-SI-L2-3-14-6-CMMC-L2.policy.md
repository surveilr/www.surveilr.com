# Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish the framework for employing Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS) within the organization. These systems play a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive information by continuously monitoring network traffic for anomalies and potential threats. The importance of this policy lies in its ability to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and to enhance the organization's overall security posture.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to employing NIDS/NIPS as a proactive measure to detect and prevent intrusions into the network. These systems will be implemented to provide real-time alerts on suspicious activities, enabling prompt response and remediation actions to safeguard our digital assets.

## Scope
This policy applies to all relevant entities and environments, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Review policy compliance **Quarterly** and present findings to senior management.
- **IT Security Personnel**: Monitor NIDS/NIPS alerts and generate incident reports **Daily**.
- **Network Administrators**: Maintain and configure NIDS/NIPS settings **Weekly** to ensure optimal functionality.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must employ NIDS/NIPS to continuously monitor and protect the network environment.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Integrate NIDS/NIPS logs into Surveilr for continuous monitoring and automated reporting of intrusion attempts.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Network security personnel must provide a signed report verifying system configuration and logs, which will be ingested into Surveilr **Monthly**.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated against the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- Percentage of NIDS/NIPS alerts reviewed within 24 hours of occurrence.
- Number of incidents documented and resolved within a specified timeframe.
- Frequency of successful configuration audits conducted on NIDS/NIPS systems.

## Exceptions
Requests for exceptions to this policy must be documented and submitted to the Compliance Officer for review. All exceptions require approval from the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and must be recorded in the exception log for accountability.

## Lifecycle Requirements
All evidence/logs generated by NIDS/NIPS must adhere to the following **Data Retention** periods:
- Logs must be retained for a minimum of 12 months.
- This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for critical actions related to NIDS/NIPS management. Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and approved.
