You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: MP.L1-3.8.3 (FII: FII-SCF-DCH-0009). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance regarding the sanitization of system media.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on sanitizing system media, emphasizing compliance with applicable regulations and standards.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify granular roles and cross-referencing, detailing specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in the sanitization process.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Outline the methods for collecting evidence of compliance, structured as follows:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the sanitization requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Use OSquery to verify that all media has been sanitized before disposal").
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define precise steps and artifacts for human verification (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the media sanitization report, which is then uploaded to Surveilr with metadata").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** objectives and **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the process for documenting and approving these exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document, formatted as [Link Text](URL) for any external references. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

Emphasize that the policy must maximize machine attestability, include specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) instructions, and explicitly use and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

The final document must end with exactly ONE References section, and no control identifiers, metadata, or additional content should follow it.
