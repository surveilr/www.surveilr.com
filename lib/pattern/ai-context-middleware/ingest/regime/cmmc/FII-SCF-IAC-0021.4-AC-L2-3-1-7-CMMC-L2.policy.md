# Privileged Function Auditing Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a standardized approach for auditing privileged functions within the organization. Auditing these activities is critical for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, enhancing security posture, and maintaining the integrity of sensitive systems. By monitoring privileged functions, the organization can detect unauthorized access, ensure accountability, and safeguard against potential misuse of privileges.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to actively auditing the execution of all privileged functions across its systems to ensure compliance with established security practices and to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access or misuse of privileges. This policy supports our overarching goal of maintaining robust security and compliance with CMMC standards.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- On-premises systems
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems

## Responsibilities
- **System Administrators**: **Audit Logs Daily** to ensure all privileged actions are recorded and discrepancies are reported.
- **Compliance Officers**: **Review Audit Reports Monthly** to evaluate adherence to auditing standards and identify anomalies.
- **IT Security Team**: **Conduct Annual Audits** of privileged functions to assess the effectiveness of the auditing process and ensure compliance with this policy.
- **All Workforce Members**: **Acknowledge Policy Annually** to confirm understanding and compliance with the auditing procedures.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**:
   - **Automated Log Collection**: Utilize logging mechanisms that record all privileged function executions in real time. Logs must include user ID, timestamp, action performed, and system affected. This data will be ingested into Surveilr for ongoing analysis.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**:
   - **Logging Configuration Verification**: Regularly verify that logging mechanisms are enabled and functioning correctly across all systems. Automated scripts will confirm the presence of necessary logs and their compliance with standards.
   - **Surveilr Integration**: Implement Surveilr to automatically collect and validate log data against predefined policies, ensuring that all privileged actions are consistently monitored and reported.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**:
   - **Manual Review and Documentation**: In instances where automation is impractical, designated personnel will manually review and document privileged function activities. This includes filling out an attestation form that records the review date, actions examined, and findings. Completed forms must be submitted to Surveilr for record-keeping.

## Verification Criteria
The organization will utilize the following **KPIs/SLAs** to measure compliance:
- **Audit Log Completeness**: 100% of privileged functions must be logged.
- **Incident Response Time**: Any identified discrepancies must be investigated and reported within **24 hours**.
- **Policy Review Compliance**: All audits must demonstrate adherence to this policy at least once per **Annual Review**.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the IT Security Team. A formal request must be submitted detailing the reason for the exception, the duration of the exception, and any compensating controls that will be implemented. All exceptions will be reviewed during the **Annual Review**.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All audit logs must be retained for a minimum of **one year** to support compliance and investigation efforts.
- **Policy Review Frequency**: This policy will be reviewed and updated at least once every **year** to ensure it remains relevant and effective.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through a formal documentation process. Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for all critical actions related to privileged functions, and all exceptions must be formally documented and reviewed.
