# CMMC Compliant Policy Document for Control: CM.L2-3.4.1 (FII: FII-SCF-AST-0002)

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the accurate inventorying of technology assets within the organization. Effective asset management is crucial for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information systems and data, particularly electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). This policy ensures that all technology assets are accounted for, authorized, and managed in compliance with applicable regulations and standards.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to maintaining an accurate and comprehensive inventory of all technology assets. This includes documenting all systems, applications, and services in use, ensuring that only authorized software products are deployed, and maintaining the necessary level of granularity for effective tracking and reporting. The organization will utilize automated methods for inventory management wherever possible, supplemented by human attestation when necessary.

## Scope
This policy applies to all technology assets across the organization, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## Responsibilities
- **IT Asset Manager:** Conducts asset inventories **Quarterly** and ensures compliance with this policy.
- **System Administrators:** Update asset records **Monthly** and report unauthorized software installations immediately.
- **Compliance Officer:** Reviews inventory reports **Annually** and ensures adherence to regulatory requirements.
- **All Employees:** Report any changes in technology assets **As Needed** to the IT Asset Manager.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT:
Automated tools will be employed to collect data on technology assets, including system configurations, installed software, and usage metrics. These tools will generate reports that reflect the current state of assets.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
Machine attestations will be gathered through automated inventory management systems that regularly scan networks and devices. These systems will log changes in real-time, ensuring that the inventory is always up-to-date and verifiable.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
When automation is impractical, designated personnel will manually verify asset inventories. This will involve:
- Conducting physical audits of technology assets **Semi-Annually**.
- Completing attestation forms that confirm the accuracy of the inventory **Post-Audit**.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated against the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- 100% of technology assets must be inventoried and documented.
- All software products must have associated business justification details.
- Inventory reports must be generated and reviewed **Quarterly**.
- Any discrepancies in the inventory must be resolved within **30 days**.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. The documentation should include:
- A description of the exception
- The rationale for the exception
- The duration of the exception

## Lifecycle Requirements
All evidence and logs related to asset inventories must be retained for a minimum of **three years**. This policy will be reviewed and updated **Annually** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through a formal attestation process. Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for all critical actions related to asset management, and formal documentation will be required for all exceptions.
