You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PE.L1-3.10.4 (FII: FII-SCF-PES-0003.3). 

The policy should be structured as follows, adhering to the requirements for a compliant document:

1. **Introduction**: Clearly state the purpose of the policy and its importance in the context of Physical & Environmental Security.
  
2. **Policy Statement**: Define the organizationâ€™s stance on generating log entries for access attempts through controlled ingress and egress points.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope, including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved, such as compliance officers and IT security personnel. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the expectation of generating log entries for access attempts.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as integrating with logging systems to capture access attempts in real-time.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Outline precise steps and artifacts for human attestation, such as having a manager review and sign off on log summaries quarterly, with metadata uploaded to Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the process for documenting these exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document without any References subsections in the individual policy sections. 

Ensure that the document maximizes machine attestability, with every section including attestation guidance. Use specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) instructions throughout the policy. All enforced keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** must be in **bold**. 

Do not include SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code in the policy. The policy must conclude with exactly ONE References section.
