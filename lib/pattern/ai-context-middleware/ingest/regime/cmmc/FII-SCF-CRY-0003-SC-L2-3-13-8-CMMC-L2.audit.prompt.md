You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

- **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
- **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
  - **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
  - **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
  - **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
- **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
  - **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
  - **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
  - **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
- **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

- **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
- **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure that cryptographic mechanisms are utilized to protect the confidentiality of data being transmitted."
  - Control Code: SC.L2-3.13.8
  - Control Question: Are cryptographic mechanisms utilized to protect the confidentiality of data being transmitted?
  - Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-CRY-0003
- **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
  "The organization is committed to safeguarding the confidentiality of sensitive data during transmission through the implementation of cryptographic protections. All data transmitted across internal and external networks must be encrypted using approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure from interception and unauthorized access."
- **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "The organization has implemented encryption protocols for all data transmissions. Evidence includes configuration logs showing encryption settings on network devices and signed documentation from the IT Security team verifying encryption settings for data transmission."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - SC.L2-3.13.8

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** SC.L2-3.13.8
**Control Question:** Are cryptographic mechanisms utilized to protect the confidentiality of data being transmitted?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-CRY-0003
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To ensure that cryptographic mechanisms are utilized to protect the confidentiality of data being transmitted.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Cryptographic mechanisms must be implemented for data transmissions.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Configuration logs showing encryption settings on network devices.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Surveilr collected evidence through automated data ingestion tracking encryption settings.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM rssd WHERE encryption_status = 'enabled';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided configuration logs confirm that encryption is enforced for all data transmissions, meeting the control requirement.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Documentation from the IT Security team verifying encryption settings.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed documentation from the IT Security team.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** IT Security team signed off on encryption settings.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The signed document is recorded in Surveilr's compliance evidence repository.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed documentation serves as valid human attestation confirming that encryption settings are in place and adhered to.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence demonstrates that the organization is effectively utilizing cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of data in transit.
* **Justification:** The combination of machine attestable evidence and human attestation provides a comprehensive view that aligns with the control's intent.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None noted.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** All required evidence has been provided and is compliant with the control's requirements and intent.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:** [N/A as the result is PASS]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:** [N/A as the result is PASS]
* **Required Human Action Steps:** [N/A as the result is PASS]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [N/A as the result is PASS]
