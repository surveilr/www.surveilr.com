You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AU.L2-3.3.8 (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0008). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and requirements:

## Introduction
- Provide a clear overview of the policy purpose regarding the protection of event logs and audit tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.

## Policy Statement
- Define the organization's commitment to ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of event logs and audit tools.

## Scope
- Explicitly define the scope of this policy, including all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- Outline specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved in the policy enforcement, such as Compliance Officer and IT Security.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT:
   - Clearly explain the control requirement for protecting event logs and audit tools.
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - Describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection and validation, such as using OSquery to verify the integrity of logs and tools.
3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - Define the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr, such as having a manager sign off on quarterly reviews of access controls.

## Verification Criteria
- Present clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** instructions and **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the previous section.

## Exceptions
- Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the process for documenting and approving these exceptions.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least **annually**').

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

### References
None

Ensure that there are no **References subsections** within individual policy sections and that the document ends with exactly ONE **References** section.
