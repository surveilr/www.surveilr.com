   2. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
      - Legal team must manually verify and document the presence of cybersecurity clauses in contracts using a checklist and upload the signed checklist into Surveilr.

2. **REQUIREMENT**: Regular review of third-party contracts.

      - Compliance Officer must complete a review report every **six months**, detailing the findings and submit it to Surveilr.

3. **REQUIREMENT**: Maintain evidence of third-party compliance.

   2. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**:

## Verification Criteria
- **SMART** compliance validation is based on:
  - **100%** of third-party contracts must contain the required cybersecurity clauses.
  - **100%** completion of semi-annual reviews for all third-party contracts, as evidenced by documented reports.
  - **0%** tolerance for non-compliance findings without documented remediation steps.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted on a case-by-case basis with documented justification. All exceptions must be formally approved by the Compliance Officer and logged in Surveilr.

## Lifecycle Requirements
