You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: MP.L2-3.8.8 (FII: FII-SCF-DCH-0010.2). 

The policy document must follow a structured format with the following sections: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. 

1. **Introduction**: Clearly state the purpose of the policy regarding the prohibition of portable storage devices without identifiable owners in organizational information systems.

2. **Policy Statement**: Define the organization's stance on the use of portable storage devices, emphasizing compliance with the control requirements.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope of the policy to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Assign specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) duties to roles involved. Use **Action Verb + Frequency** for each task (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review).

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., using OSquery to track portable device usage).
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Provide specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr (e.g., manager signing off on the device inventory report).

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes precise attestation methods, and adheres to the specified structure and content rules. **BOLD** enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the document. 

The policy document must NOT include References subsections within individual policy sections, and it must end with exactly ONE References section.
