You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "SI.L1-3.14.1" (FII: FII-SCF-VPM-0001). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy **MUST** follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** 

2. **Policy Sections**: Each section should:
   - Explain the control requirement.
   - Suggest machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
   - Suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report").
   - IMPORTANT: Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections. The References section appears ONLY at the very end of the document.

3. **Markdown Elements**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Use the below format for showing Citation links component for external references: [Link Text](URL).

4. **Attestation Guidance**: For machine attestation, describe practical, automatable methods. For human attestation, describe precise steps and artifacts.

5. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like containment or violation sanction, include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** and a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

6. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems**.

7. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

8. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

9. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Define **specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency)** for each role mentioned and **link to or reference** related organizational plans.

10. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

11. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

12. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

13. **Verification Criteria**: Must include clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

14. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

15. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end.

16. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text **MUST** explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

17. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content. MUST NOT contain control id, control question, and FII id.** 

Begin drafting the policy content now while ensuring all guidelines are followed, especially the prohibition on References subsections within each policy section. End the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
