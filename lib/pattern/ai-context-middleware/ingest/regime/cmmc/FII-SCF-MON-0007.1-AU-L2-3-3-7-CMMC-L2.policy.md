# Time Synchronization Policy for Control: AU.L2-3.3.7

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this Time Synchronization Policy is to ensure that all internal system clocks across the organization are accurately synchronized with an authoritative time source. Proper time synchronization is critical in maintaining the integrity of time-sensitive data, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and protecting the organization's information security posture.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to synchronizing all internal system clocks with an authoritative time source to ensure accurate timekeeping across all systems and applications. This commitment supports compliance with the CMMC control AU.L2-3.3.7 and enhances the overall security and reliability of our information systems.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all organizational systems and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)

## 4. Responsibilities
- **System Administrators**: **Implement** time synchronization protocols **quarterly** and ensure system clocks are synchronized with the authoritative time source.
- **IT Security Team**: **Monitor** compliance with time synchronization **monthly** and report any discrepancies to management.
- **Compliance Officer**: **Review** the policy and its implementation **annually** and ensure all documentation is up to date.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: All systems must synchronize their clocks with an authoritative time source, such as NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automated evidence collection methods include:
   - Collecting logs from time synchronization services (e.g., NTP logs).
   - Verifying configurations via OSquery to ensure systems are configured to synchronize with the authorized time source.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Personnel must **conduct** periodic reviews of time synchronization settings **biannually** and provide certification of compliance.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through metrics tied to **KPIs/SLAs**, including:
- Percentage of systems successfully synchronizing with the authoritative time source (target: 100%).
- Frequency of compliance reports submitted by the IT Security Team (target: monthly).

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Requests for exceptions should include the rationale, duration, and specific conditions under which the exception applies.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Logs and evidence of time synchronization must be retained for a period of **6 years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
- All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through signed attestation.
- Comprehensive audit logging is required for all critical actions related to time synchronization, including creation, modification, and termination of synchronization settings.
- Documentation for all exceptions must include justification, duration, and approval records.
