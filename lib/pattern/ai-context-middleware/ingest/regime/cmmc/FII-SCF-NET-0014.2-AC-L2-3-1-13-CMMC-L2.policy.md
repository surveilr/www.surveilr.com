# Remote Access Cryptography Policy

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all remote access sessions within the organization are protected by robust cryptographic mechanisms. This is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information transmitted over potentially insecure networks. By employing strong encryption protocols, the organization can mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and data breaches, thereby safeguarding the integrity of its information systems.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to utilizing cryptographic mechanisms for all remote access sessions. This commitment ensures that sensitive information is adequately protected during transmission and that compliance with relevant regulatory standards is maintained.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all remote access sessions to the organizationâ€™s systems, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information

## 4. Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Implement encryption protocols for remote access sessions **Quarterly**.
- **System Administrators**: Configure and maintain cryptographic settings on all remote access solutions **Monthly**.
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and validate adherence to this policy **Annually**.
- **Employees**: Report any anomalies in remote access sessions **Immediately**.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Cryptographic mechanisms are necessary to protect remote access sessions against eavesdropping and tampering, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize Surveilr to automate the verification of encryption protocols in use for remote access sessions, confirming compliance with established security standards.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Document manual checks of encryption settings and perform annual certifications of remote access tools, ensuring that all actions are recorded for auditing purposes.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Successful implementation of encryption for 100% of remote access sessions.
- Evidence of regular audits conducted by the IT Security Team every **Quarter**.
- Documentation of any anomalies or exceptions reported by employees, with resolutions logged **Within 48 hours**.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Requests for exceptions must include justification and a risk assessment. Documentation of approved exceptions will be maintained for audit purposes.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence of compliance must be retained for a minimum of **3 years**.
- **Policy Review**: This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **Annually** to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding of this policy and their commitment to compliance. Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for all critical actions related to remote access sessions, documenting access, changes, and exceptions.
