# Media Sanitization Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the sanitization of system media to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and ensure compliance with applicable regulations and standards. Proper sanitization is critical to safeguarding the organizationâ€™s data integrity and confidentiality, particularly prior to the disposal or reuse of media.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to sanitizing system media in accordance with the highest standards of data protection. We will ensure that all media containing sensitive information is sanitized to a degree that is commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or release for reuse. This policy aligns with regulatory requirements and industry best practices.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information

## Responsibilities
- **IT Department**: **Sanitize media** prior to disposal or reuse **(Before disposal/reuse)**.
- **Compliance Officer**: **Review sanitization processes** for adherence to policy **(Quarterly)**.
- **IT Manager**: **Approve media sanitization reports** and ensure they are uploaded to Surveilr **(Upon completion of sanitization)**.
- **All Employees**: **Report any media containing sensitive information** that requires sanitization **(As needed)**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: All system media must be sanitized before disposal or reuse.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Use OSquery to verify that all media has been sanitized before disposal.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The IT manager must sign off on the media sanitization report, which is then uploaded to Surveilr with metadata.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following **SMART** objectives:
- **Specific**: All media must be sanitized according to the defined procedures.
- **Measurable**: 100% of media must have documented sanitization reports.
- **Actionable**: The IT Department must complete sanitization before any media disposal or reuse.
- **Relevant**: Compliance with this policy is essential for protecting sensitive information.
- **Time-bound**: All sanitization must be completed within 24 hours prior to disposal or reuse.

Key performance indicators (**KPIs/SLAs**) will include:
- Percentage of media sanitized within the required timeframe.
- Number of exceptions documented and approved.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. A formal request must be submitted detailing the rationale for the exception, which will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

## Lifecycle Requirements
All evidence and logs related to media sanitization must be retained for a minimum of **Data Retention** period of 6 years. This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to media sanitization, and formal documentation will be required for all exceptions.
