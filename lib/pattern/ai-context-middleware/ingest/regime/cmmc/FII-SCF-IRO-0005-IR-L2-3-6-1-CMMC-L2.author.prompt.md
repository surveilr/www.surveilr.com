You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "IR.L2-3.6.1" (FII: FII-SCF-IRO-0005). 

The policy must follow this structure:

## Introduction
- Explain the importance of training personnel in their incident response roles and responsibilities.

## Policy Statement
- Define the organization’s commitment to ensuring that all personnel are adequately trained for their incident response roles.

## Scope
- Explicitly define the policy’s scope to include all personnel involved in incident response, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for roles such as the Incident Response Team, Compliance Officer, and IT Security.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   - Describe the training requirements for personnel in incident response roles.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   - Suggest automated methods to validate training completion, such as integrating with Learning Management Systems (LMS) to verify training records.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   - Specify the actions required, such as having personnel sign a training completion log, which is then uploaded to Surveilr with metadata (review date, reviewer name).

## Verification Criteria
- Outline clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs** related to training completion and frequency of training sessions.

## Exceptions
- Define any exceptions to the policy, including the process for documenting and approving these exceptions.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail **Data Retention** policies for training records (e.g., retain for 6 years) and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., **Annual Review**).

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
