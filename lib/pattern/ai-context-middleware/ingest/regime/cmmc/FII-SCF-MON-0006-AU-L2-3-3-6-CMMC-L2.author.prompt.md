You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AU.L2-3.3.6 (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0006). 

The policy must follow this structure:

## Introduction
- Provide a brief overview of the importance of event log report generation in detecting and assessing anomalous activities.

## Policy Statement
- Clearly state the policy regarding the generation of event log reports.

## Scope
- Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit data.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, such as Compliance Officer and IT Security, and link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   - Describe the requirement for event log report generation capability.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   - Suggest machine attestation methods, such as automating the generation and storage of event log reports using Surveilr.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   - Specify the necessary human actions, such as a designated individual signing off on the generated reports, and how this will be documented and ingested into Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

## Exceptions
- Outline any exceptions to the policy, including documentation requirements for each exception.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and **Annual Review** frequency for policy updates.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.

### References
- List external references using [Link Text](URL) format, or state "None" if there are no references.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes explicit attestation guidance, and adheres to the formatting and structural requirements specified above. Remember, do not include References subsections within individual policy sections; the References section must appear only at the end of the document.
