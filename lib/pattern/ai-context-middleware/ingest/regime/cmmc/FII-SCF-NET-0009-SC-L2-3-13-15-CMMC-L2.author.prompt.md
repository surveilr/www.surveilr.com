You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "SC.L2-3.13.15" (FII: FII-SCF-NET-0009). 

The policy must include the following sections in the exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, and References**. Each section should be clearly marked with H2 headings (##).

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance regarding the protection of the authenticity and integrity of communications sessions.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to maintaining secure communications.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and any channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role involved in maintaining communication security.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest concrete, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using OSquery for validation of configurations or automated logging mechanisms.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify actions that must be taken by individuals, including documentation methods for human-attested evidence.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the previous section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any permissible exceptions to the policy along with the process for approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and establish a mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections and conclude the document with exactly one **References** section. The **References** section should only contain external links in the format: [Link Text](URL) if applicable, or state "None" if there are no external references. 

**IMPORTANT**: Use standard Markdown formatting and ensure all specified keywords are **BOLD**: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

Failure to follow these instructions will result in non-compliance.
