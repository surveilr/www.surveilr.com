# Digital Media Usage Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the use of digital media within our organization to ensure the secure handling of sensitive data, particularly electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). By restricting certain types of digital media on systems and system components, we aim to mitigate risks associated with data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential compliance violations in accordance with the CMMC control MP.L2-3.8.7.

This includes, but is not limited to, external USB drives, portable hard drives, CDs/DVDs, and any other removable storage devices that have not been explicitly approved for use within the organizationâ€™s infrastructure. 

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access or use our systems, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI
