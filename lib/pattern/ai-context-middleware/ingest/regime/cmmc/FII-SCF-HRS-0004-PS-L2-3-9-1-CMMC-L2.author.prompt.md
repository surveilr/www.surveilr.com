You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PS.L2-3.9.1 (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0004). 

## Policy Structure
1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the policy and its importance in managing personnel security risk.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization’s commitment to screening individuals prior to authorizing access.
3. **Scope**: Define the policy’s applicability to all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
4. **Responsibilities**: Specify task-level duties for roles involved in personnel security, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Describe the requirement for managing personnel security risk.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., using automated background check systems).
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Outline specific human actions required (e.g., HR must maintain signed acknowledgment forms).
6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Detail any exceptions to the policy, including documentation requirements.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence and mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.
10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document, without any References subsections in individual sections.

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure that all sections contain explicit instructions for machine attestability and human attestability when applicable. The policy must replace general statements with **SMART** instructions, ensuring operational detail and specificity. Emphasize the importance of including **KPIs/SLAs**, and remember to **BOLD** all enforced keywords as required. 

End the policy document with exactly ONE References section, and do not include any References subsections within policy sections.
