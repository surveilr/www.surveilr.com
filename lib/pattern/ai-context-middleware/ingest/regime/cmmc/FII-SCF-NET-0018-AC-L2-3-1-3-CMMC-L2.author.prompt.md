You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.3 (FII: FII-SCF-NET-0018). 

The policy document must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. Each section should be structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the purpose of this policy.
  
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on enforcing Internet-bound network traffic through a proxy device for URL content filtering and DNS filtering.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's applicability to all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit data.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify task-level duties for each role involved, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format. For example, "IT Security: daily log review."

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. **REQUIREMENT**: State the requirement for using a proxy device.
   - 2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe practical, automated methods for validating compliance, such as collecting logs from the proxy device to confirm filtering activities.
   - 3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Outline specific actions and artifacts, like "The IT manager must sign off on the monthly review of filtered traffic logs."

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

7. **Exceptions**: Detail how exceptions to this policy will be documented and approved.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

The document must follow the specified structure and formatting guidelines, using Markdown elements appropriately. Importantly, do NOT include References subsections within individual policy sections; the References section should only appear at the very end of the document. Ensure that all enforced keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are explicitly bolded throughout the policy text. 

End the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
