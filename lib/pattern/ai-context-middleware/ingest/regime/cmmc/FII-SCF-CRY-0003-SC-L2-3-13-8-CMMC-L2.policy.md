# Cryptographic Protections Policy

## Introduction
In today’s digital landscape, the transmission of sensitive data is increasingly vulnerable to unauthorized access and cyber threats. Therefore, implementing robust cryptographic mechanisms is essential to protect the confidentiality of data being transmitted. Cryptography serves as a critical defense layer against data breaches, ensuring that only authorized parties can access sensitive information as it travels across networks. This policy outlines the organization’s commitment to utilizing cryptographic protections for all data in transit, reducing the risk of data exposure and ensuring compliance with relevant regulatory standards.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to safeguarding the confidentiality of sensitive data during transmission through the implementation of cryptographic protections. All data transmitted across internal and external networks must be encrypted using approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure from interception and unauthorized access.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)
- All channels and methods used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**:
  - Conduct a risk assessment of data transmission channels bi-annually.
  - Implement and maintain encryption protocols across all systems.
  - Monitor compliance with cryptographic standards on an ongoing basis.

- **Network Administrators**:
  - Configure and validate encryption settings on all network devices quarterly.
  - Document any changes to cryptographic configurations immediately.

- **Compliance Officer**:
  - Review and approve cryptographic mechanisms and policies annually.
  - Ensure that all staff receive training on the importance of cryptographic protections.

- **End Users**:
  - Adhere to encryption protocols when transmitting sensitive data.
  - Report any incidents of suspected data exposure immediately.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **Requirement**: The necessity of implementing cryptographic mechanisms for data transmission is paramount to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive data remains confidential during transit. This aligns with the organization's compliance obligations and risk management strategies.

2. **Machine Attestation**:
   - Utilize Surveilr to automate the collection of evidence regarding cryptographic configurations. This includes tracking the encryption status of data in transit, logging any deviations from established protocols, and validating the proper application of cryptographic protections.

3. **Human Attestation**:
   - The IT Security team must provide signed documentation verifying encryption settings for data transmission. This documentation will be ingested into Surveilr as part of the compliance evidence repository.

## Verification Criteria
- Compliance with this policy will be validated against established Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) including:
  - Percentage of data transmissions utilizing approved cryptographic protocols (target: 100%).
  - Number of compliance incidents related to data transmission (target: 0 incidents).
  - Frequency of cryptographic configuration audits (target: biannual).

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions will only be granted under specific circumstances where alternative security measures are in place, and must be reviewed annually to assess ongoing necessity.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Logs and evidence related to cryptographic protections must be retained for a period of three years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an annual review to ensure its effectiveness and relevance in the face of evolving threats and compliance requirements.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through signed documentation. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all actions related to cryptographic configurations, ensuring traceability and accountability.
