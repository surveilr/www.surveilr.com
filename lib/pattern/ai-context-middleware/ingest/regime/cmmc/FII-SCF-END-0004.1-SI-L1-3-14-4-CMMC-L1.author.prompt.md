You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: SI.L1-3.14.4 (FII: FII-SCF-END-0004.1). 

The policy document must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections; the References section should only be at the end of the document.

1. **Introduction**: Clearly define the purpose of the policy regarding automatic updates of antimalware technologies.

2. **Policy Statement**: Outline the organization's commitment to maintaining updated antimalware technologies.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings for each requirement:
     - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Explain the control requirement.
     - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using OSquery to verify antimalware updates.
     - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Describe specific actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** KPIs/SLAs defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including documentation requirements.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by including specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) instructions throughout. Emphasize the importance of documenting human attestation methods when automation is impractical.

At the end of the document, include exactly ONE References section formatted as follows:
- If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format.
- If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

Remember to **bold** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the policy text. Failure to bold any keyword is a critical non-compliance error.
