# Policy Document for Control: PE.L1-3.10.1 (FII: FII-SCF-PES-0012)

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines and requirements for the physical and environmental security of system components within our organization. This policy is critical in minimizing potential damage from physical and environmental hazards, such as natural disasters, vandalism, and unauthorized access. By ensuring robust physical security measures are in place, we protect our assets, sensitive information, and maintain compliance with applicable security standards.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to maintaining the highest standards of physical and environmental security for all system components. This policy mandates that all system components be strategically located within secure areas to mitigate risks associated with physical threats and unauthorized access, thereby ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information systems.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities, including but not limited to:
- Physical facilities housing system components
- Cloud-hosted systems and applications
- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems involved in the management of physical and environmental security
All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors must adhere to these guidelines to ensure comprehensive security across all environments.

## Responsibilities
- **Security Officer**: Conducts annual security assessments of physical locations to ensure compliance with this policy.
- **Facility Manager**: Inspects secure areas bi-monthly to verify the integrity of physical security measures.
- **IT Manager**: Implements and maintains machine attestation tools quarterly to monitor the security status of system components.
- **Compliance Officer**: Reviews and updates this policy annually and oversees the documentation of any exceptions.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Ensure that all system components are located in secure areas to minimize risks from physical and environmental hazards.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize OSquery to verify the geographic and physical location of all system components and confirm they reside in designated secure areas.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The Facility Manager must complete and submit a quarterly report, signed and dated, confirming that all system components maintain their security status and remain in secure locations.

## Verification Criteria
- All machine attestations must be performed quarterly, with a compliance rate of 100% for system components located in secure areas.
- Human attestations should be submitted within 5 business days after the end of each quarter, with a goal of achieving 100% completion.
- The effectiveness of physical security measures will be assessed through annual reviews, aiming for a minimum of 95% compliance with established security protocols.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and justified in writing. The following process must be followed:
- Submit an exception request to the Compliance Officer detailing the rationale for the exception.
- Obtain written approval from the Security Officer before implementing any exception.
- Document the exception in the organization's compliance records for review during audits.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs related to physical and environmental security must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy requires an annual review to ensure its relevance and effectiveness, with updates made as necessary based on findings from security assessments and audits.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy by signing a formal acknowledgment document. Comprehensive logs of critical actions, including inspections and evidence collection efforts, must be maintained. Any exceptions approved must also be formally documented and accessible for auditing purposes.
