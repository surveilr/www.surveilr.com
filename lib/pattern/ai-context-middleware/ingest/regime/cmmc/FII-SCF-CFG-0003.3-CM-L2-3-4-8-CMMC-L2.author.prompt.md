You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "CM.L2-3.4.8" (FII: "FII-SCF-CFG-0003.3"). 

The policy document must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, and References**. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy and its importance in managing authorized applications on systems.
  
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on allowlisting and denylisting applications.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope to include all relevant entities, environments, and systems, including cloud-hosted systems and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role involved in application control.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - Use numbered subheadings per requirement:
     - "1. REQUIREMENT:"
     - "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:"
     - "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:"
   - Describe practical, automatable methods for machine attestability and specific actions for human attestations.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation that are tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for handling any exceptions to the policy.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify **Data Retention** periods for evidence and the frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, as well as comprehensive audit logging for critical actions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by emphasizing automated evidence collection and verification methods. Where human attestation is necessary, provide clear steps for documentation and ingestion into Surveilr. 

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections. The References section must only appear at the very end of the document. 

**BOLD** all enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

After the References section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or additional content.
