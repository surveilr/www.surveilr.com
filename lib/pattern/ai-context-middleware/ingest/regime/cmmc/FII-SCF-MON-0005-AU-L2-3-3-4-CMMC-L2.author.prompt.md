You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AU.L2-3.3.4 (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0005).

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** 

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the policy's purpose and importance in ensuring compliance with log processing failures.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly define the organization's commitment to alerting appropriate personnel in the event of a log processing failure and taking actions to remedy the disruption.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, ensuring clarity in responsibilities related to log processing and alerting.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings for each requirement:
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Explain the control requirement related to alerting on log processing failures.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence, such as integrating with monitoring systems to capture alerts.
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Describe specific actions required from personnel, including documentation methods for attestation artifacts.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Define clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **SMART** objectives and **KPIs/SLAs** established in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including how they will be documented and approved.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require acknowledgement from workforce members, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.

At the end of the policy document, include a single **References** section without any References subsections in individual policy sections. Ensure all keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are **BOLD** in the text. 

Do not include conversational filler. The policy must end with exactly ONE **References** section.
