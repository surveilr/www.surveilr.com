You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

* **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
* **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
    * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
    * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
    * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
* **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
    * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
    * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
    * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
* **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization facilitates the implementation of cryptographic protections controls using known public standards and trusted cryptographic technologies."
    * **Control Code:** SC.L2-3.13.11
    * **Control Question:** Does the organization facilitate the implementation of cryptographic protections controls using known public standards and trusted cryptographic technologies?
    * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-CRY-0001
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for implementing cryptographic protections that safeguard sensitive data within the organization. By adhering to known public standards and utilizing trusted cryptographic technologies, we aim to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information transmitted and stored across various platforms. This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Automated evidence collection through OSquery for endpoint data encryption settings, logs showing encryption activity for sensitive data, and signed attestation forms from employees confirming training on cryptographic protections."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - SC.L2-3.13.11

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** SC.L2-3.13.11
**Control Question:** Does the organization facilitate the implementation of cryptographic protections controls using known public standards and trusted cryptographic technologies?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-CRY-0001
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization facilitates the implementation of cryptographic protections controls using known public standards and trusted cryptographic technologies.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must implement cryptographic protections that are aligned with known public standards.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated evidence collection through OSquery for endpoint data encryption settings.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery was utilized to collect evidence of cryptographic configuration compliance across systems.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM encryption_settings WHERE status = 'enabled';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence shows that all endpoints are configured to use encryption in accordance with the established standards.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Logs of encryption activity must be maintained and reviewed regularly.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Logs showing encryption activity for sensitive data.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated collection of encryption logs from data storage systems.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM encryption_logs WHERE action = 'encrypt';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The logs demonstrate that encryption activities are captured and reviewed as per the policy requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Employees must complete training related to cryptographic protections.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed attestation forms from employees confirming training on cryptographic protections.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Employees documented their completion of mandatory training.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Attestation forms were submitted to Surveilr for ingestion and record-keeping.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed forms confirm that employees have completed the required training, aligning with the policy expectations.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence meets the intent of the control to establish robust cryptographic protections.
* **Justification:** The evidence showcases both machine and human attestations that collectively demonstrate compliance with the control's requirements.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None noted; all evidence aligns well with the control's purpose.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence provided clearly demonstrates compliance with the control's requirements and intent. All necessary cryptographic protections are in place and verified through both automated logs and human attestations.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")
