You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization adjusts logical and physical access authorizations to systems and facilities upon personnel reassignment or transfer, in a timely manner."
  * **Control Code:** PS.L2-3.9.2
  * **Control Question:** Does the organization adjust logical and physical access authorizations to systems and facilities upon personnel reassignment or transfer, in a timely manner?
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-HRS-0008
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy outlines the procedures and responsibilities for adjusting logical and physical access authorizations in response to personnel reassignment or transfer. Ensuring timely updates to access authorizations is critical for maintaining the security of systems and facilities, thereby protecting sensitive information and resources from unauthorized access."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Surveilr logs show access adjustments made within 48 hours of personnel reassignment notifications from HR. Signed acknowledgment forms from personnel confirming understanding of adjusted access rights have been stored in Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - PS.L2-3.9.2

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** PS.L2-3.9.2
**Control Question:** Does the organization adjust logical and physical access authorizations to systems and facilities upon personnel reassignment or transfer, in a timely manner?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-HRS-0008
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization adjusts logical and physical access authorizations to systems and facilities upon personnel reassignment or transfer, in a timely manner.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Access authorizations must be adjusted **timely** to reflect changes in personnel roles to prevent unauthorized access to systems and facilities.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Surveilr logs show access adjustments made within 48 hours of personnel reassignment notifications from HR.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion through API calls and logging mechanisms within the Surveilr platform.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SQL query to verify timestamp of access change logs against personnel reassignment notifications.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** Evidence demonstrates timely adjustments of access rights were logged and are in compliance with policy requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Personnel must complete a signed acknowledgment form confirming their understanding of the adjusted access rights.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed acknowledgment forms from personnel confirming understanding of adjusted access rights have been stored in Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Personnel signing acknowledgment forms post-adjustment.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Surveilr stores the signed documentation, providing a record of acknowledgment.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed acknowledgment forms serve as evidence of compliance and understanding, fulfilling the requirement for human attestation.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the organization effectively adjusts access rights in a timely manner and maintains records of acknowledgement.
* **Justification:** The evidence not only meets the literal requirements but also reflects the underlying intent of the control, ensuring security and compliance.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** N/A

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence provided confirms that both machine and human attestation processes are functioning effectively, fulfilling the controlâ€™s intent and requirements.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [For each missing piece of evidence identified in Section 2, state *exactly* what is needed.]
    * [Specify the required format/type for each missing piece.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [For each instance of non-compliant evidence identified in Section 2, clearly state *why* it is non-compliant and what *specific correction* is required.]
    * [Specify the action needed.]
