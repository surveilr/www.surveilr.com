You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L1-3.1.20 (FII: FII-SCF-DCH-0013). 

The policy must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy MUST follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Each section should include:
   - An explanation of the control requirement.
   - Suggested machine attestation methods.
   - Suggested human attestation methods where unavoidable.

2. **Attestation Guidance**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation. Describe practical, automatable methods for machine attestation and precise steps for human attestation, including artifacts and ingestion methods into Surveilr.

3. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, along with a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

4. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit data.

5. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

6. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when human attestation is needed.

7. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section MUST define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

8. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code. DO NOT include References subsections within policy sections.

11. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

12. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

13. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

14. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

15. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end.

16. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text MUST explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

17. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content.**

Ensure that References subsections do NOT appear after each policy section, and end the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
