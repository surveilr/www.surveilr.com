You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
** Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To maintain an accurate record of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities to prevent unauthorized access and ensure security."
Control Code: PE.L1-3.10.1,
Control Question: Does the organization maintain a current list of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities (except for those areas within the facility officially designated as publicly accessible)?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-PES-0002
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy establishes the framework for maintaining a current list of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities. It is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring compliance with applicable regulations. By maintaining an accurate access list, the organization can mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and enhance overall security posture."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "The organization provides a current access list report from Surveilr, detailing personnel authorized to access secured areas, along with corresponding access logs for the past quarter."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - PE.L1-3.10.1

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** PE.L1-3.10.1
**Control Question:** Does the organization maintain a current list of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities (except for those areas within the facility officially designated as publicly accessible)?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-PES-0002
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To maintain an accurate record of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities to prevent unauthorized access and ensure security.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Maintain a current list of personnel with authorized access, ensuring it is updated regularly.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Access list report from Surveilr showing current authorized personnel.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated access management system logging and tracking personnel access in real-time.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM access_list WHERE authorized = 'true';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided access list report meets the requirements for maintaining an updated record of authorized personnel.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Conduct regular access audits.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Audit log reviewed showing logs from the last quarter indicating personnel access.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Quarterly access audits performed by Compliance Officer.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Human action of running access audits recorded in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The audit log confirms that access audits were conducted, thereby fulfilling the control requirement.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided aligns well with the control's intent to maintain an accurate access list and prevent unauthorized access.
* **Justification:** The organization has demonstrated compliance through both machine and human attestations, fulfilling the control's objectives effectively.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None identified.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence clearly demonstrates adherence to the control requirements, with both machine and human attestations present and compliant.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [If applicable, state what is needed.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [If applicable, specify the action needed.]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [If applicable, list steps a human auditor or compliance officer needs to take.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [If applicable, outline the process for re-submission of the corrected/missing evidence for re-evaluation.]
