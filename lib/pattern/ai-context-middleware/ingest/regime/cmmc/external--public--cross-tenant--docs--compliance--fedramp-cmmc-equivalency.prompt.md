# FedRAMP Authorization and Equivalency for Defense Industrial Base

## What is FedRAMP Equivalency and how does it differ from FedRAMP Authorization?

FedRAMP Equivalency is an alternative compliance pathway established under DFARS 252.204-7012 that allows Defense Industrial Base (DIB) contractors to use Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs) that meet security requirements equivalent to the FedRAMP Moderate baseline for processing, storing, or transmitting covered defense information (CDI). Critically, FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency does not confer actual FedRAMP Moderate Authorization - it provides flexibility for contractors to use cloud services that demonstrate equivalent security controls without requiring formal federal authorization.

**Key Distinction**: While FedRAMP Authorization involves official government Authority to Operate (ATO) with accepted risk by an Authorizing Official, FedRAMP Equivalency requires 100% compliance with FedRAMP Moderate baseline controls with complete risk avoidance, as there is no government sponsor to accept residual risk.

## DFARS 252.204-7012 Cloud Service Requirements

The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement mandates that contractors using external cloud service providers for covered defense information must ensure those providers meet security requirements equivalent to FedRAMP Moderate baseline. This requirement drives the need for the equivalency pathway, providing contractors with cloud options beyond traditionally FedRAMP-authorized services while maintaining required security standards.

## Current FedRAMP Program Transition Status

**Legislative Changes**: The 2022 FedRAMP Authorization Act replaced the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) with a FedRAMP Board, fundamentally altering program operations and oversight responsibilities.

**Transition Timeline**:
- **Phase I (Completed)**: October-December 2024 transition of JAB-authorized systems to designated lead agencies (DoD, DHS, GSA, or FedRAMP)
- **Phase II (In Progress)**: Implementation of multi-agency continuous monitoring with FedRAMP PMO support

**Impact**: Former P-ATO letters have terminated, and previously JAB-authorized systems now operate under new agency-specific oversight models.

## Roles and Responsibilities Framework

**DIB Contractors**:
- Validate CSO meets FedRAMP Moderate equivalent standards
- Review Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) Body of Evidence (BoE)
- Provide Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) to assessors
- Approve CSO usage and confirm Incident Response Plan compliance
- Report security incidents per contract requirements

**Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs)**:
- Conduct comprehensive CSO security assessments
- Deliver complete Body of Evidence package including:
  - System Security Plan (SSP) with security policies, contingency plans, incident response procedures
  - Security Assessment Plan (SAP) with test procedures and annual penetration testing
  - Security Assessment Report (SAR) with risk exposure analysis and monthly scanning results
  - Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) with continuous monitoring strategy

**DIBCAC (Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center)**:
- Reviews CSP Body of Evidence for FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency
- Validates DFARS 252.204-7012 and 252.204-7020 compliance
- Implements contractor-required security controls
- Accessible at https://www.dcma.mil/DIBCAC/

**C3PAO (CMMC Third-Party Assessment Organizations)**:
- Reviews CSP Body of Evidence during CMMC assessments
- Validates DFARS compliance for cybersecurity maturity certification
- Implements contractor-required controls within CMMC framework

## Compliance Requirements and Risk Management

**100% Compliance Mandate**: CSOs must achieve complete compliance with the latest FedRAMP Moderate Baseline following assessment by a FedRAMP-recognized 3PAO. Unlike traditional FedRAMP authorizations, no residual risk acceptance is permitted.

**POA&M Management**:
- Continuing operational POA&Ms are acceptable during CSO operation
- All high and critical risk findings must be remediated before receiving equivalency determination
- Remediation timeframes: 30/90/180 days based on criticality level
- Must include remediation plans and scheduled completion dates

## Cloud Service Provider Recommendations

**Best Practices for CSPs**:
1. **Early 3PAO Engagement**: Partner with FedRAMP-recognized assessment organizations during planning phases
2. **Readiness Assessment**: Conduct preliminary evaluations before formal testing to identify gaps
3. **Strong Internal Governance**: Maintain robust security documentation and incident reporting procedures
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement monthly infrastructure and web scanning with annual validation
5. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct annual penetration testing with validated methodologies
