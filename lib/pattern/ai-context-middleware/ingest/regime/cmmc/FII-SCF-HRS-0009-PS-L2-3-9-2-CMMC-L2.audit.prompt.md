You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization governs the termination of individual employment to ensure access to sensitive information and systems is revoked timely and securely."
Control Code: PS.L2-3.9.2,
Control Question: Does the organization govern the termination of individual employment?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-HRS-0009
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the controlled and compliant termination of individual employment within the organization. It is crucial to ensure that employee terminations are conducted in a manner that protects both the organization's assets and the confidentiality of sensitive information. This policy aims to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access to systems and data following an employee's departure."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "1. HR maintains a termination checklist with signed acknowledgments from employees regarding the return of company property, documented in Surveilr. 2. Automated logs from the SIEM indicate access was revoked within 24 hours of termination notification. 3. Exit interview notes documented by line managers in Surveilr. 4. Inventory management systems show tracking of returned company assets."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - PS.L2-3.9.2

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** [Control Code from input]
**Control Question:** [Control Question from input]
**Internal ID (FII):** [FII from input]
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** [Description of intent/goal from input]

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must document the termination of employment, including the reasons for termination and the date of termination.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated logs from the SIEM indicating access was revoked within 24 hours of termination notification.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated log collection through SIEM tools.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM rssd.access_logs WHERE action='revoke' AND timestamp BETWEEN [termination date range].
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence demonstrates that access was revoked in accordance with the policy requirements.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Ensure that all company property is retrieved from the departing employee.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Inventory management systems show tracking of returned company assets.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated alerts generated by inventory management systems.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM rssd.inventory WHERE status='returned' AND employee_id=[employee_id].
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence confirms the return of company assets as per policy expectations.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Conduct exit interviews to gather feedback and ensure understanding of termination responsibilities.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Exit interview notes documented by line managers in Surveilr.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Manual entry of exit interview notes into Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM rssd.exit_interviews WHERE employee_id=[employee_id].
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The documented notes provide adequate evidence of the exit interview process being followed.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** HR will maintain a termination checklist, including signed acknowledgments from the employee regarding the return of company property.
    * **Provided Evidence:** HR maintains a termination checklist with signed acknowledgments documented in Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** HR's responsibility to initiate the termination process and record acknowledgments.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The checklist is stored within Surveilr for validation.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence meets the requirements set forth in the control.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent and Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence collectively demonstrates that the organization effectively governs the termination of individual employment in alignment with the control's intent.
* **Justification:** The documented processes ensure timely revocation of access, retrieval of company property, and collection of feedback, addressing the risks associated with unauthorized access after termination.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit findings confirm that the organization adheres to the requirements and intent outlined in the control. All aspects of the termination process are well-documented, and evidence supports compliance.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [For each missing piece of evidence identified in Section 2, state *exactly* what is needed.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [For each instance of non-compliant evidence identified in Section 2, clearly state *why* it is non-compliant and what *specific correction* is required.]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [List precise steps a human auditor or compliance officer needs to take.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [Outline the process for re-submission of the corrected/missing evidence for re-evaluation.]
