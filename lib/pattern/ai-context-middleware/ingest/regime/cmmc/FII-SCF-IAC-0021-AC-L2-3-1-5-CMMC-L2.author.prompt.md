You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.5 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0021). 

## Instructions for Policy Authoring:

1. **Document Structure**: 
   - Structure the document with the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, and References**. 
   - Each section must be clearly defined with H2 headings (##).

2. **Policy Content**: 
   - **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the purpose of the policy and its importance in supporting organizational compliance with the concept of least privilege.
   - **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organizational commitment to implementing least privilege by allowing only authorized access to processes necessary to accomplish assigned tasks.
   - **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
   - **Responsibilities**: Assign specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for roles like Compliance Officer, IT Security, and others, ensuring clarity in their responsibilities.

3. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings for each evidence collection requirement:
     - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the control requirement.
     - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting compliance evidence through Surveilr.
     - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Describe specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr for instances where human attestation is necessary.

4. **Verification Criteria**: 
   - Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the previous section.

5. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: 
   - Replace general statements with **SMART** instructions, detailing 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, with specific time-bound metrics.

6. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: 
   - Include data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

7. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: 
   - Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.

8. **Markdown Elements**: 
   - Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Ensure that enforced keywords are **BOLD**: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

9. **References**: 
   - The document must end with exactly ONE References section. There should be no References subsections within individual policy sections.

Ensure that all guidance provided is strictly followed, emphasizing machine attestability and compliance with the CMMC control requirements.
