You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: SI.L1-3.14.5 (FII: FII-SCF-END-0004.7). 

The policy document must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** 

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance in maintaining endpoint security through anti-malware technologies.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to ensuring that anti-malware technologies are continuously running in real-time and cannot be disabled or altered by non-privileged users without specific authorization.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review). Ensure to use **Action Verb + Frequency** for clarity and link to related organizational plans.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Describe the requirement for continuous operation of anti-malware technologies.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using OSquery to verify that anti-malware solutions are active on all endpoints.
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Specify the actions required from personnel, such as a manager's approval for any exceptions, along with documentation methods for ingestion into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for requesting and documenting exceptions to the policy.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by including attestation guidance in every section. Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. 

The document must end with exactly ONE **References** section, and no References subsections should appear within individual policy sections.
