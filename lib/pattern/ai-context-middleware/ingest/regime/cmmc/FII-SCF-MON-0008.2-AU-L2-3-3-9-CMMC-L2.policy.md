# Event Log Management Access Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for restricting access to the management of event logs within the organization. Effective management of event logs is critical for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information systems. This policy ensures that only authorized personnel are granted access to sensitive log management functions, thereby minimizing risks associated with unauthorized changes or malicious activities.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to restricting access to event log management exclusively to privileged users who demonstrate a specific business need. Access will be granted based on clearly defined roles and responsibilities, ensuring that individuals can only perform actions necessary for their job functions.

## Scope
This policy applies to all relevant entities and environments within the organization, including:
- On-premises systems
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems

All personnel, including employees, contractors, and third-party partners, are subject to this policy.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: **Conduct audits** of access to event logs **quarterly** to ensure compliance with this policy.
- **System Administrators**: **Review and validate** user access to event log management **monthly** and make adjustments as necessary based on role changes.
- **Compliance Officer**: **Provide training** on log management access and policy adherence **annually** to all relevant staff.
- **Human Resources**: **Notify** the IT Security Team of any personnel changes that may affect access to event log management **as they occur**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must ensure that access to event log management is restricted to only those with a legitimate business need.
   
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize Surveilr to automate the collection of access logs and changes to user permissions in real-time. Set up Surveilr to generate alerts for any unauthorized access attempts or changes in user roles.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Require privileged users to document their access justification and actions taken in a logbook, which will be ingested into Surveilr. This log must include the date, time, user ID, and a brief description of the actions performed.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated using the following **SMART** KPIs/SLAs:
- **98%** of privileged user access logs reviewed must match authorized access records during audits.
- **100%** of users must complete training on log management access policies within **30 days** of onboarding.
- **All** unauthorized access attempts must be logged and addressed within **24 hours** of detection.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented using the following process:
- Submit a formal request to the Compliance Officer detailing the justification for the exception.
- The request must include the expected duration of the exception and the approval from the department head.
- All exceptions will be reviewed and approved on a case-by-case basis with documentation retained for **audit purposes**.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Event logs and related evidence must be retained for a minimum of **6 years** from the date of creation.
- This policy must be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members with access to event log management must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through documented attestation. Comprehensive audit logging is required for every critical action related to log management, and all exceptions must be formally documented and available for review during audits.
