You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L1-3.1.1 (FII: FII-SCF-TPM-0005.2). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the policy purpose and its importance in ensuring cybersecurity and data privacy compliance in contracts with subcontractors and suppliers.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organizationâ€™s commitment to including cybersecurity and data privacy requirements in all relevant contracts.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope explicitly, covering all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties for each role involved in the policy enforcement, using action verbs and indicating the frequency of tasks.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Follow the mandatory structure:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence, emphasizing how machine evidence will be collected and validated.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Provide precise steps and artifacts that a human must perform to ensure compliance, detailing how attestation will be documented and ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the process for approval and documentation of exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs, and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document, formatted using [Link Text](URL) for external references, if applicable.

Ensure that:
- Each policy section does NOT include References subsections.
- The document ends with exactly ONE References section.
- All enforced keywords are explicitly used and **BOLD**ed: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

Focus on providing detailed operational steps and specific, verifiable actions to maximize machine attestability while ensuring clarity and compliance.
