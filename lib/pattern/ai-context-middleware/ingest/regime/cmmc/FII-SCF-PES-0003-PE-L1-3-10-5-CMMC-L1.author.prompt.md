You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PE.L1-3.10.5 (FII: FII-SCF-PES-0003). 

The policy must adhere to the following structure without including References subsections in individual sections. The document must end with exactly ONE References section. 

1. **Introduction**: Clearly explain the purpose of the policy and its importance in enforcing physical access authorizations.

2. **Policy Statement**: Define the overarching policy on enforcing physical access authorizations for all physical access points to facilities.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role mentioned. Include cross-references to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement for physical access authorizations.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, like using access control systems to log entry and exit.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define the exact actions, artifacts, and how they are ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** objectives and **KPIs/SLAs** defined.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including a process for documenting these exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., **Annual Review**).

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and documentation for all exceptions.

10. End the document with a single **References** section. 

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance for every requirement. Include **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** in bold text to meet compliance requirements. 

Do not output any control identifiers, metadata, or additional content after the References section. The policy must be comprehensive, clear, and fully compliant with the guidelines provided.
