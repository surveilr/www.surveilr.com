You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization enforces physical access authorizations for all physical access points (including designated entry/exit points) to facilities (excluding those areas within the facility officially designated as publicly accessible)."
Control Code: PE.L1-3.10.5,
Control Question: Does the organization enforce physical access authorizations for all physical access points (including designated entry/exit points) to facilities (excluding those areas within the facility officially designated as publicly accessible)?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-PES-0003
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy establishes the framework for enforcing physical access authorizations to facilities within the organization. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive areas, thereby safeguarding our assets, information, and personnel. Effective enforcement of physical access control is vital in mitigating risks related to unauthorized access, ensuring operational integrity, and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Access authorization logs from the access control system for the past month showing all entry and exit events; surveillance footage from the electronic surveillance system for the same period; a signed access authorization log documenting personnel access; and a monthly review report of access logs."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - PE.L1-3.10.5

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** [Control Code from input]
**Control Question:** [Control Question from input]
**Internal ID (FII):** [FII from input]
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** [Description of intent/goal from input]

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must ensure that physical access authorizations are established and enforced at all entry and exit points to facilities.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Access authorization logs from the access control system for the past month showing all entry and exit events.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Access control system logs ingested into Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM access_logs WHERE event_date BETWEEN '2025-06-01' AND '2025-06-30';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The access logs demonstrate that all entry and exit points are monitored and that access is logged accurately.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Maintain electronic surveillance systems that capture and store footage of access points.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Surveillance footage from the electronic surveillance system for the same period.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Footage metadata ingested into Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM surveillance_footage WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2025-06-01' AND '2025-06-30';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The footage corroborates the access logs and provides visual evidence of compliance.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Maintain a signed access authorization log that documents who has been granted access and for what purpose.
    * **Provided Evidence:** A signed access authorization log documenting personnel access.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Personnel must sign the access authorization log.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Stored in Surveilr as a scanned document.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed log is present and corresponds to the access events.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Review access authorization logs monthly.
    * **Provided Evidence:** A monthly review report of access logs.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Monthly audit of access logs.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Report stored in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The review report indicates that access logs were reviewed for anomalies.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** Based on the totality of the provided evidence, it genuinely demonstrates that the control's purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The organization has established a comprehensive framework for physical access control, evidenced by the access logs, surveillance footage, and the signed authorization log.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None observed.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The provided evidence demonstrates full compliance with the control requirements and the underlying intent of ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive areas.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [No missing evidence identified.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [No non-compliant evidence identified.]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [No specific actions needed.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [No re-audit needed.]
