# Identification & Authentication Policy

## 1. Introduction
This policy outlines the organization's approach to Identification and Authentication (IA) to ensure that all organizational users and processes are uniquely identified and centrally authenticated, authorized, and audited. Effective IA practices are critical for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the organization's information systems. This policy establishes the framework for implementing **IA.L1-3.5.1** and **IA.L1-3.5.2** controls to protect against unauthorized access and to ensure accountability in system usage.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to implementing robust user identification, authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms. All organizational users must be uniquely identified and authenticated before accessing systems and data. Each access attempt will be logged and audited to ensure compliance with security protocols. Unauthorized access will not be tolerated, and appropriate actions will be taken against violators.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all organizational users, including employees, contractors, and third-party vendors, across all environments. It encompasses cloud-hosted systems, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels utilized for managing user identities. All systems and applications that handle user authentication must adhere to this policy.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - **Review** and update the identification and authentication policy **Annually**.
  - **Ensure** compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies **Quarterly**.
  
- **IT Security Personnel**: 
  - **Implement** user identification and authentication mechanisms **Immediately** after deployment of any new system.
  - **Monitor** authentication logs and access attempts for anomalies **Daily**.
  - **Report** any identified security incidents related to user authentication **As Required**.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must ensure that all users are uniquely identified and centrally authenticated, authorized, and audited.
  
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize automated logging tools to capture authentication events and system access logs, ensuring that these logs are securely stored and can be retrieved for review. Implement identity management systems that provide machine-readable evidence of user access and authentication.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Conduct annual training sessions for all users on identification and authentication policies. Maintain documentation of attendance and completion, which will be stored in Surveilr for compliance auditing. Users must sign an acknowledgment form indicating their understanding of the policy, which will be logged in Surveilr.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 100% of users must be uniquely identified in the system.
- 95% of all authentication attempts must be logged within 24 hours.
- 100% completion of annual training sessions for all personnel on identification and authentication policies.

## 7. Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. An exception request must include the rationale for the exception, the duration for which it is required, and any compensating controls that will be implemented to mitigate risk.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All authentication logs and evidence of user identification must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy must undergo a comprehensive review **Annually** to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with current regulations and best practices.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Audit logs must be maintained for all access attempts, with particular attention to failed authentication attempts. Any exceptions to the policy must be formally documented, including the approval process.
