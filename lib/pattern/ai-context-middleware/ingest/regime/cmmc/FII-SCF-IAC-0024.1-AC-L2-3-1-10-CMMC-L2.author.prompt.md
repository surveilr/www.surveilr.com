You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.10 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0024.1). 

**Policy Structure**: The policy **MUST** follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the control requirement regarding pattern-hiding displays and its importance in protecting sensitive information.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly outline the organization's commitment to implementing pattern-hiding displays to conceal information during session locks.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using **Action Verb + Frequency**. For example, "IT Security: daily review of display settings."

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the requirement for pattern-hiding displays.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automatable methods for evidence collection, e.g., "Utilize Surveilr to verify configuration settings of display systems."
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Describe the necessary human actions and documentation, e.g., "The IT manager must sign a quarterly review report confirming display compliance."

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including the necessary approvals.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the **Annual Review** frequency for this policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, along with comprehensive audit logging for critical actions.

**Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown elements, including headings, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. 

**Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content. MUST NOT contain control id, control question, and fii id.** 

**References subsections should NOT appear after each policy section.**
