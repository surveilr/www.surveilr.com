# CMMC Level 1 Assessment Guide

## How do you conduct a CMMC Level 1 self-assessment and what are the specific requirements?

**CMMC Level 1 Self-Assessment** is a self-conducted evaluation process where Organizations Seeking Assessment (OSAs) determine their compliance with 15 basic safeguarding requirements for Federal Contract Information (FCI) protection, as specified in FAR Clause 52.204-21 and codified in 32 CFR ยง 170.15.

### Assessment Framework and Methodology
Level 1 self-assessments use **NIST SP 800-171A assessment objectives** modified for FCI rather than CUI, employing three assessment methods:

**Examine Method**: Review, inspect, observe, study, or analyze assessment objects including specifications (policies, procedures, security plans), mechanisms (hardware, software, firmware safeguards), activities (protection-related actions), and individuals.

**Interview Method**: Hold discussions with personnel to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence from staff at different organizational levels.

**Test Method**: Exercise assessment objects under specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior, providing hands-on demonstration of requirement implementation.

### Assessment Findings and Scoring
Level 1 assessments result in three possible findings per 32 CFR ยง 170.24:

**MET**: All applicable objectives satisfied based on final-form evidence (no drafts or working papers accepted). Includes Enduring Exceptions documented in system security plans and temporary deficiencies with operational plans of action.

**NOT MET**: One or more objectives not satisfied. A single NOT MET assessment objective causes failure of the entire security requirement.

**NOT APPLICABLE (N/A)**: Security requirement doesn't apply at assessment time. Equivalent to MET for scoring purposes.

**Compliance Requirement**: All 15 Level 1 requirements must achieve MET or N/A status for successful assessment completion.

### 15 Level 1 Security Requirements by Domain

**Access Control (AC) - 4 Requirements**:
- AC.L1-b.1.i: Limit system access to authorized users, processes, and devices
- AC.L1-b.1.ii: Limit access to authorized transactions and functions 
- AC.L1-b.1.iii: Verify and control external system connections
- AC.L1-b.1.iv: Control information on publicly accessible systems

**Identification and Authentication (IA) - 2 Requirements**:
- IA.L1-b.1.v: Identify system users, processes, and devices
- IA.L1-b.1.vi: Authenticate user, process, and device identities

**Media Protection (MP) - 1 Requirement**:
- MP.L1-b.1.vii: Sanitize or destroy media containing FCI before disposal/reuse

**Physical Protection (PE) - 2 Requirements**:
- PE.L1-b.1.viii: Limit physical access to authorized individuals
- PE.L1-b.1.ix: Escort visitors, maintain access logs, control physical access devices

**System and Communications Protection (SC) - 2 Requirements**:
- SC.L1-b.1.x: Monitor, control, and protect communications at system boundaries
- SC.L1-b.1.xi: Implement separated subnetworks for publicly accessible components

**System and Information Integrity (SI) - 4 Requirements**:
- SI.L1-b.1.xii: Identify, report, and correct system flaws timely
- SI.L1-b.1.xiii: Provide malicious code protection at appropriate locations
- SI.L1-b.1.xiv: Update malicious code protection when new releases available
- SI.L1-b.1.xv: Perform periodic and real-time malicious code scanning

### Key Assessment Considerations
**Evidence Requirements**: All evidence must be in final form - drafts, working papers, and unofficial policies are unacceptable. Organizations must demonstrate actual implementation, not just documentation.

**External Service Provider (ESP) Compliance**: Requirements may be satisfied through enterprise components or ESPs, including cloud providers, managed service providers, or cybersecurity-as-a-service providers.

**Assessment Flexibility**: Organizations determine appropriate assessment methods and objects to accomplish objectives in the most cost-effective manner with sufficient confidence.

**Scope Definition**: Assessment scope must be defined per 32 CFR ยง 170.19, covering all assets that process, store, or transmit FCI, excluding Specialized Assets (IoT, IIoT, OT, GFE, Restricted Information Systems, Test Equipment).

### Assessment Deliverables
**SPRS Submission**: Primary result is submission of Level 1 compliance results into the Supplier Performance Risk System.

**Self-Assessment Report**: Contains findings associated with the self-assessment, documenting MET/NOT MET/N/A determinations for each requirement.

**Third-Party Assistance**: Organizations may engage third parties to assist with self-assessment while maintaining self-assessment status (not certification).

### Implementation Examples and Practical Application
Each requirement includes specific implementation examples, such as maintaining authorized user lists (AC.L1-b.1.i), establishing visitor escort procedures (PE.L1-b.1.ix), implementing firewall boundary protection (SC.L1-b.1.x), and configuring automated malware updates (SI.L1-b.1.xiv).

The Level 1 self-assessment process emphasizes practical cybersecurity implementation over extensive documentation, making it accessible to organizations of all sizes while ensuring fundamental FCI protection capabilities are established and maintained.
