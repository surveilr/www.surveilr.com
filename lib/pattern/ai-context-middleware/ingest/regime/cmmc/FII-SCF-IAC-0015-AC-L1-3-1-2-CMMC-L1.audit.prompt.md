You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To establish a robust framework for account management governance within the organization, ensuring that access to sensitive information is controlled, monitored, and reviewed regularly."
Control Code: AC.L1-3.1.2,
Control Question: Does the organization proactively govern account management of individual, group, system, service, application, guest and temporary accounts?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-IAC-0015
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The organization is committed to proactive account management for all types of accounts, including individual, group, system, service, application, guest, and temporary accounts. This commitment ensures that access to sensitive information is controlled, monitored, and reviewed regularly, thereby protecting the organizationâ€™s assets and maintaining compliance with applicable regulations."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "1. API integrations to validate access controls and generate automated reports on account status and access levels. 2. Signed quarterly account review report by the IT manager stored in Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AC.L1-3.1.2

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** AC.L1-3.1.2
**Control Question:** Does the organization proactively govern account management of individual, group, system, service, application, guest and temporary accounts?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-IAC-0015
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To establish a robust framework for account management governance within the organization, ensuring that access to sensitive information is controlled, monitored, and reviewed regularly.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** All accounts must be created, modified, and deactivated following established protocols, ensuring that access is granted based on the principle of least privilege.
    * **Provided Evidence:** API integrations to validate access controls and generate automated reports on account status and access levels.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** API calls to validate access controls.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM account_status WHERE access_level = 'least_privilege';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence provided demonstrates that the organization is utilizing automated API integrations to validate access controls, aligning with the control's requirements.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly account review report.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed quarterly account review report by the IT manager stored in Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** IT manager's manual review and sign-off.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Stored signed PDF in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed report indicates that the required human attestation has been completed, fulfilling the control's requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Quarterly reviews of account management policies and practices.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed quarterly account review report by the IT manager stored in Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** IT manager's manual review and sign-off.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Stored signed PDF in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence demonstrates that the IT manager has conducted the required quarterly review and provided the necessary attestation.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence sufficiently demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The organization has established a framework for account management governance, as evidenced by the automated validation of access controls and the IT manager's signed quarterly review.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None identified.
