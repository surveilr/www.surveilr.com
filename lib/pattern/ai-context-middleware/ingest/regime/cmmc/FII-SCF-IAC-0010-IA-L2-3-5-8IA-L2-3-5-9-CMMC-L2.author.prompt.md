You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "IA.L2-3.5.8, IA.L2-3.5.9" (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0010). 

Your policy must follow the required structure with the following sections: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. Ensure each section is comprehensive, clear, and aligned with the goal of maximizing machine attestability through Surveilr.

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the purpose and importance of securely managing authenticators for users and devices.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to securely managing authenticators, including specific controls and objectives.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's applicability to all relevant entities, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels involving the creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in the management of authenticators, linking to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - Use numbered subheadings:
     1. **REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement.
     2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Collect endpoint configuration and installed software details via OSquery").
     3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr (e.g., "The IT manager must sign the quarterly authenticator review report, which is uploaded to Surveilr").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **SMART** objectives and defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy along with their approval process.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging of critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that no **References subsections** appear within individual policy sections, and conclude the document with exactly one **References** section at the end. Remember to **BOLD** keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the document.
