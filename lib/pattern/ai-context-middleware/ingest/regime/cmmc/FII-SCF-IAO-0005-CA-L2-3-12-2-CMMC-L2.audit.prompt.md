You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization generates a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to document planned remedial actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities."
Control Code: CA.L2-3.12.2,
Control Question: Does the organization generate a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), or similar risk register, to document planned remedial actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-IAO-0005
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish a structured approach for the generation and management of a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to document planned remedial actions for security control deficiencies. The POA&M serves as a critical tool in identifying, tracking, and mitigating weaknesses in information assurance, ensuring the organization can effectively respond to vulnerabilities and maintain compliance with relevant standards. The organization is committed to documenting weaknesses or deficiencies identified during security assessments and implementing corrective actions through the development and maintenance of a comprehensive POA&M."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "POA&M updates have been ingested into Surveilr from JIRA, tracking actions taken to address deficiencies. There are records of human attestation in the form of signed documentation from designated personnel acknowledging the updates made to the POA&M."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - CA.L2-3.12.2

**Overall Audit Result:** [PASS]  
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]  
**Auditor Role:** [CMMC Auditor]  
**Control Code:** [CA.L2-3.12.2]  
**Control Question:** [Does the organization generate a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), or similar risk register, to document planned remedial actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities?]  
**Internal ID (FII):** [FII-SCF-IAO-0005]  
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** [The organization generates a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to document planned remedial actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities.]

## 1. Executive Summary

The audit findings indicate that the organization has successfully generated and maintained a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) in accordance with the control requirements. The provided evidence demonstrates compliance with the expected machine attestable processes as well as the necessary human attestations. Key evidence includes timely updates to the POA&M as tracked in Surveilr, confirming the systematic approach to addressing identified deficiencies.

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** A POA&M must be generated whenever security control deficiencies are identified during assessments or audits.
    * **Provided Evidence:** POA&M updates have been ingested into Surveilr from JIRA.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion from JIRA via API.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM POA_Milestones WHERE status = 'open' AND due_date < CURRENT_DATE; 
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence provided demonstrates that the organization has established a mechanism for generating and updating the POA&M in real-time, fulfilling the requirement for automatic updates upon identification of deficiencies.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Upon completion of updates to the POA&M, designated personnel must sign off on the updates.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Records of human attestation in the form of signed documentation from designated personnel.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Designated personnel review and confirm the updates made to the POA&M.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Signed documentation stored in Surveilr's document management system.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed documentation provides adequate human attestation confirming that updates to the POA&M have been duly acknowledged and approved by responsible personnel.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided not only meets the literal requirements of the control but also reflects the organization's commitment to addressing security deficiencies systematically and transparently.
* **Justification:** The POA&M serves its intended purpose of tracking and mitigating risks, aligning with the underlying spirit of the control, which is to ensure continuous improvement in the organization's security posture.
