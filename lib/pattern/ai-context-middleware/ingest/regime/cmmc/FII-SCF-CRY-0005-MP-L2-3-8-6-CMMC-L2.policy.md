# Cryptographic Protections Policy

## Introduction
The use of **cryptographic mechanisms** is essential in safeguarding sensitive information, specifically in preventing unauthorized disclosure of **data at rest**. As organizations increasingly rely on digital storage solutions, the risk of data breaches escalates. By employing robust cryptographic protections, we can ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI) against unauthorized access and disclosure.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to implementing comprehensive **cryptographic protections** to secure **data at rest**. We will utilize industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols to encrypt sensitive information stored in our systems, thereby ensuring compliance with applicable regulations and safeguarding our stakeholders' privacy.

## Scope
This policy applies to all entities and environments that create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems

All employees, contractors, and third-party service providers must adhere to this policy.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and approve the policy **quarterly**; ensure alignment with regulatory requirements.
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - Conduct a **daily log review** to monitor encryption settings and compliance.
  - Implement and maintain cryptographic mechanisms as per this policy.
- **Data Owners**: Ensure that ePHI is encrypted according to this policy before storage.
  
This policy is linked to the following organizational plans:
- Incident Response Plan
- Sanction Policy

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Cryptographic mechanisms must be utilized to protect **data at rest** to mitigate risks of unauthorized access.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**:
   - Utilize configuration management tools to verify encryption settings.
   - Monitor logs for encryption compliance and generate automated reports.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**:
   - Conduct quarterly reviews by relevant personnel to validate encryption implementations.
   - Document findings and ingest verification results into Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be established based on the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 100% of systems storing ePHI must employ encryption.
- All encryption logs should be reviewed and reported with a 100% completion rate **monthly**.

## Exceptions
Permissible exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved through a formal process. Exception requests must be submitted to the Compliance Officer for review prior to implementation.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to this policy must be retained for **6 years**.
- This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with evolving regulations.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging for critical actions will be mandatory, and formal documentation must be maintained for all exceptions.
