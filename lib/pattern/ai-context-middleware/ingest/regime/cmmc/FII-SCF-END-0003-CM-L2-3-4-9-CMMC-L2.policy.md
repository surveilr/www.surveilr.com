# CMMC Policy Document for Control: CM.L2-3.4.9

## Introduction
This policy outlines the procedures and requirements for prohibiting unauthorized software installations across all organizational systems, including cloud-hosted environments, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information (ePHI). The goal is to ensure the integrity and security of organizational systems by restricting software installation to those with explicitly assigned privileged status.

## Policy Statement
The organization will implement automated mechanisms to prohibit software installations on all devices and systems unless explicitly granted privileged status. This policy aligns with CMMC control CM.L2-3.4.9 and aims to enhance the security posture of the organization.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities, including but not limited to:
- **Cloud-hosted systems**
- **SaaS applications**
- **Third-party vendor systems**
- **All channels** that create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**
  - **Implement and maintain** automated mechanisms to restrict software installations **(Daily)**
  - **Monitor system logs** for unauthorized installation attempts **(Weekly)**
  
- **System Administrators**
  - **Review and assign** privileged status for software installations as necessary **(As needed)**
  - **Document** all approved installations in the asset management system **(Daily)**
  
- **Compliance Officer**
  - **Conduct audits** to verify compliance with this policy **(Quarterly)**
  - **Facilitate** policy training for workforce members **(Annually)**

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT:
The organization will utilize automated mechanisms to prohibit software installations without explicit privileged status.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
- Automated logs will capture all software installation attempts, including timestamps and user credentials.
- Monitoring tools will automatically generate alerts for unauthorized installation attempts.
- Reports generated every week will validate the effectiveness of the installation restrictions.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
- Workforce members with privileged status must complete an attestation form after software installation, which will be logged into Surveilr.
- Attestation includes the software name, installation date, and approval reference, to be submitted within 24 hours of installation.

## Verification Criteria
- **Monthly reviews** of automated logs to ensure 100% compliance with installation restrictions.
- **Quarterly audits** by the Compliance Officer to assess the effectiveness of the automated mechanisms and human attestations against established **KPIs/SLAs**.
- **Weekly reports** must demonstrate zero unauthorized installation attempts.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted on a case-by-case basis and must be documented and approved by the IT Security Team and the Compliance Officer. All exceptions will be reviewed during the **Annual Review** of this policy.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All logs related to software installation attempts must be retained for a minimum of **two years**.
- This policy will undergo a mandatory **Annual Review** to ensure relevance and compliance with regulatory standards.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy upon initial training and during the **Annual Review**.
- Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for all critical actions related to software installation and management.
