# Password-Based Authentication Policy

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements for enforcing complexity, length, and lifespan considerations to ensure strong criteria for password-based authentication within the organization. The policy is designed to meet the CMMC control IA.L2-3.5.7 and is applicable to all systems, including cloud-hosted environments, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

## Policy Statement
The organization mandates the implementation of strong password policies to protect sensitive information and maintain compliance with security regulations. This includes requirements for password complexity, length, and lifespan, which must be adhered to across all relevant systems.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- All personnel who access organizational systems
- All cloud-hosted systems
- All SaaS applications in use
- All third-party vendor systems that interact with the organizationâ€™s data

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team:**
  - Develop and enforce password policies **(Monthly)**
  - Conduct training sessions for staff on password best practices **(Quarterly)**
  - Monitor password compliance using automated tools **(Daily)**

- **System Administrators:**
  - Implement password policies on all systems **(As needed)**
  - Generate reports on password compliance **(Monthly)**

- **End Users:**
  - Adhere to established password policies **(Ongoing)**
  - Participate in training and awareness activities **(As scheduled)**

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:** Password complexity, length, and lifespan enforcement.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Use tools like OSquery to collect password policy configurations daily, ensuring passwords meet complexity and length requirements.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly password policy review report, submitting it into Surveilr.

2. **REQUIREMENT:** Password expiration and rotation.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Implement automated scripts to enforce password expiration every 90 days and notify users via email 14 days prior to expiration.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** End users must acknowledge receipt of password expiration notifications via the Surveilr platform.

3. **REQUIREMENT:** Password reuse prevention.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Configure systems to prevent reuse of the last 10 passwords, verified through automated compliance checks.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** System Administrators must review and document any exceptions for password reuse in Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- Compliance with password complexity and length policy must be validated through automated reports generated by OSquery with a target compliance rate of **95%** or higher.
- Password lifespan must be adhered to, with a goal of **100%** of users changing passwords every 90 days.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy require formal documentation, including:
- A signed request from the IT Security Team
- Approval from senior management
- Documentation of justification and the duration of the exception
All exceptions must be logged into Surveilr for tracking and review.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** Password policy compliance logs must be retained for a minimum of **two years**.
- **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update:** This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure ongoing relevance and compliance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy by signing a compliance form. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to password management. Formal documentation will be retained for any exceptions granted.
