You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L1-3.1.1 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0020). 

The policy must follow this structured format:

## Introduction
- Clearly state the purpose of the policy and its importance in enforcing Logical Access Control (LAC) permissions in accordance with the principle of "least privilege."

## Policy Statement
- Define the overall policy regarding access control, emphasizing adherence to the least privilege principle.

## Scope
- Explicitly define the scope of this policy, ensuring it includes all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems (Business Associates).

## Responsibilities
- Outline specific task-level duties for each role involved (e.g., Compliance Officer, IT Security) using **Action Verb + Frequency** to ensure clarity.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT:
   - Describe the requirement for enforcing logical access control permissions.

2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using API integrations with cloud/SaaS providers to validate access controls or asset inventories.

3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - Provide detailed steps a human must take for attestation, including the exact action, artifact, and method for documenting and ingesting this evidence into Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

## Exceptions
- Identify any exceptions to the policy, detailing the process for requesting and documenting exceptions.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail **Data Retention** policies, specifying minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., retain for 6 years) and mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

### References
- Include relevant external references at the end of the document using the [Link Text](URL) format. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections. The document must conclude with exactly ONE References section.
