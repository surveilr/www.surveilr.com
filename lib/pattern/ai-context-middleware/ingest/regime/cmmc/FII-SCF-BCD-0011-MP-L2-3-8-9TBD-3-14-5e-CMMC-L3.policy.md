## Introduction

The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the creation and verification of recurring backups of data, software, and system images. Ensuring the availability of data through reliable backup processes is critical for maintaining business continuity and meeting regulatory requirements. This policy aims to safeguard organizational assets and mitigate risks associated with data loss, thereby supporting the organization's Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).

## Policy Statement

The organization is committed to creating recurring backups of all critical data, software, and system images. These backups will be verified for integrity to ensure that they can be restored effectively in the event of data loss or system failure. This commitment is essential to maintaining operational resilience and ensuring compliance with applicable standards.

## Scope

This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- On-premises systems
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems

All personnel involved in the backup process are required to adhere to this policy.

## Responsibilities

- **IT Security: daily verification of backup integrity**
- **System Administrators: weekly execution of backup processes**
- **Data Owners: monthly review of backup reports**
- **IT Manager: quarterly assessment of backup strategies**
- **Compliance Officer: annual review of policy adherence**

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT

Backups must be created on a recurring basis, with verification processes in place to ensure their integrity. This includes daily backups of critical data and weekly verification of backup success.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION

Utilize automated scripts to verify backup integrity on a weekly basis. These scripts should generate logs that can be ingested into Surveilr for compliance tracking.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION

The IT Manager must sign off on the monthly backup report, which includes details of the backups performed, any issues encountered, and the results of integrity checks. This report must be uploaded into Surveilr for record-keeping.

## Verification Criteria

Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 100% of scheduled backups must be completed successfully.
- 95% of backup integrity checks must pass without errors.
- Monthly backup reports must be signed off by the IT Manager within 5 business days of the end of each month.

## Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the IT Manager. A formal exception request must include the reason for the exception and a proposed alternative solution. All exceptions will be reviewed during the **Annual Review** of this policy.

## Lifecycle Requirements

All evidence and logs related to backup processes must be retained for a minimum of **Data Retention** period of 6 years. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for all critical actions related to backups, including creation, verification, and restoration. Formal documentation must be kept for all exceptions and reviewed during the **Annual Review** process.
