You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "CM.L2-3.4.3" (FII: FII-SCF-CHG-0002). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide a clear overview of the purpose of the policy related to technical configuration change control processes.
  
2. **Policy Statement**: Define the organization's stance on governing technical configuration changes, ensuring clarity and compliance.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Clearly outline specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, such as Compliance Officer and IT Security. Ensure to link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery actions.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings per requirement:
     - 1. REQUIREMENT: Explain the control requirement.
     - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect configuration change logs daily").
     - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Describe precise steps and artifacts for human verification (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly configuration change review report").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** instructions and **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the process for approval and documentation.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least **annually**').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by including attestation guidance in each section. All sections must be written in standard Markdown formatting, using headings, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. 

The **References** section must appear only at the end of the document, and no References subsections should be included within individual policy sections. 

Finally, ensure that the keywords **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are explicitly used and **BOLD** in the policy text. 

End the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
