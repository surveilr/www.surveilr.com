You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: SI.L1-3.14.2 (FII: FII-SCF-END-0004). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and requirements:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, along with a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation methods.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when human attestation is necessary.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section must define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned and explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require **Workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, **Comprehensive audit logging** for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

9. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods, avoiding SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code. Do not include References subsections within policy sections.

10. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings for each requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

11. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

12. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

13. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

14. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end.

15. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

16. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document**. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content. 

17. **References Section Format**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

Ensure that no References subsections appear after each policy section, and end the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
