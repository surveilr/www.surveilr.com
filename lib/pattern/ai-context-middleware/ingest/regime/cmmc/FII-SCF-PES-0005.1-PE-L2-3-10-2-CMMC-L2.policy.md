# Physical Intrusion Monitoring Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for monitoring physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment within the organization. This policy is critical in ensuring the security of physical spaces where sensitive information is stored, processed, or transmitted. By adhering to this policy, the organization aims to protect its assets from unauthorized access and maintain compliance with CMMC control PE.L2-3.10.2.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to the continuous monitoring of physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment. This commitment ensures that any unauthorized access attempts are detected and addressed promptly, thereby safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining the integrity of our physical security measures.

## Scope
This policy applies to all relevant entities and environments, including but not limited to:

- **Measurable**: At least 95% of alarm events are reviewed within 24 hours of occurrence.
- **Achievable**: All personnel assigned to monitoring roles are trained and equipped.
- **Relevant**: All incidents of unauthorized access must trigger an immediate investigation.
- **Time-bound**: Compliance reviews conducted quarterly with results documented within 30 days of review.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted under specific circumstances, such as maintenance outages or equipment upgrades. Justifications for exceptions must be documented, and the duration of each exception shall not exceed 30 days unless otherwise approved by the Compliance Officer.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All logs and evidence must be retained for a minimum of 6 years to comply with regulatory requirements.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will be reviewed annually to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with applicable standards.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to physical intrusion monitoring, including the documentation of all exceptions. Audit logs will be reviewed monthly to ensure ongoing compliance.
