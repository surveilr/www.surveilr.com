## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for governing the secure use of external parties, systems, and services for storing, processing, and transmitting data. This policy is vital for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of sensitive information, ensuring compliance with the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Control AC.L1-3.1.20. 

## Policy Statement
The organization mandates that all external parties, systems, and services utilized for data handling must adhere to established security standards to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or breaches. This includes regular assessments and validations of external systems’ compliance with the organization’s data security policies.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities, including cloud-hosted systems, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used for creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting data. This encompasses all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers engaging with or managing sensitive data on behalf of the organization.

## Responsibilities

- **Data Governance Officer:**
  - **Review external data handling agreements** annually to ensure compliance. 
  - **Coordinate with third-party vendors** to assess their security posture biannually.
  
- **IT Security Team:**
  - **Conduct security assessments** of external systems quarterly.
  - **Monitor compliance** with data handling policies continuously.

- **All Workforce Members:**
  - **Complete annual training** on data handling and security policies.
  - **Report any security incidents** immediately following the established reporting protocol.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   External parties must secure data handling processes to safeguard sensitive information.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   Utilize security monitoring tools to automatically verify compliance with security standards in external systems daily. For example, use OSquery to assess configuration compliance and collect asset inventories.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   The Data Governance Officer will review and sign an annual compliance validation report, which will be ingested into Surveilr as evidence of adherence to the policy.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following **SMART** criteria:
- **Complete compliance audits** of external systems must achieve a minimum score of 90% based on predefined security benchmarks.
- **Incident response times** must meet **KPIs/SLAs** of containing any data breach incidents within 48 hours.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Data Governance Officer. Any exceptions must include a risk assessment and a mitigation plan to address potential vulnerabilities.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** Evidence and logs related to external data handling must be retained for a minimum of three years.
- **Mandatory Frequency for Policy Review:** This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure relevance and compliance with evolving standards and regulations.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through a signed attestation form, which will be documented and stored in Surveilr. Additionally, comprehensive audit logging will be enforced for all critical actions related to external data handling.
