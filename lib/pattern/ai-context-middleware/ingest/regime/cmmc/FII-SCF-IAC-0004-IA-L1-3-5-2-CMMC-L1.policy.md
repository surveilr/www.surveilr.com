# CMMC Policy for Control: IA.L1-3.5.2

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the unique identification and centralized authentication, authorization, and auditing (AAA) of devices prior to establishing a connection to organizational systems. This policy ensures that all devices are authenticated using bidirectional authentication methods that are cryptographically-based and replay resistant, thereby protecting sensitive information and maintaining compliance with CMMC standards.

## Policy Statement
All devices connecting to organizational systems must be uniquely identified and authenticated using centralized AAA mechanisms. This process must include cryptographically-based bidirectional authentication to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data transmitted over the network. Non-compliance with this policy will result in corrective actions as outlined in the Responsibilities section.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Implement and maintain AAA mechanisms; conduct **Annual Review** of authentication processes.
- **Network Administrators**: Monitor device connections and ensure compliance with authentication protocols; perform weekly audits of connection logs.
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and report on compliance status quarterly; escalate non-compliance issues to management.
- **All Employees**: Acknowledge understanding of this policy and report any unauthorized device connections immediately.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Unique identification and centralized authentication of devices.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Use OSquery to collect device inventories and authentication logs daily.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Manager signs quarterly validation reports confirming device compliance with authentication protocols.

2. **REQUIREMENT**: Bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically-based and replay resistant.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Implement TLS/SSL certificates for all device connections and log certificate validation events.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: IT Security Team conducts monthly reviews of authentication logs and documents findings.

3. **REQUIREMENT**: Audit of device connections.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize SIEM tools to aggregate and analyze connection logs in real-time.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Compliance Officer reviews and signs off on audit reports bi-annually.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 100% of devices must be authenticated before connection.
- 95% of authentication logs must be reviewed within 24 hours of connection.
- All exceptions must be documented and reviewed within 48 hours.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions will be reviewed during the **Annual Review** and must include a justification for the deviation from standard procedures.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All authentication logs must be retained for a minimum of 12 months.
- This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure ongoing compliance and relevance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through a signed attestation form. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to device authentication. Formal documentation will be required for all exceptions to this policy.
