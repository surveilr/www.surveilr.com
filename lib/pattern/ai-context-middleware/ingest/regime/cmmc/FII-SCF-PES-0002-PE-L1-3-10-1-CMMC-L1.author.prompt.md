You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PE.L1-3.10.1 (FII: FII-SCF-PES-0002). 

The policy document must include the following sections in the exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance regarding maintaining a current list of personnel with authorized access to organizational facilities.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the policy regarding personnel access to organizational facilities, emphasizing compliance with CMMC requirements.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, such as Compliance Officer: quarterly access list review; IT Security: daily access log monitoring. Reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr where human attestation is necessary.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification, duration, and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., "retain for 6 years") and the frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that no **References** subsections appear within individual policy sections. The document must end with exactly ONE **References** section. Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code for technical terms. Emphasize the keywords **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** by making them **bold**. 

Do not include control identifiers, control questions, or FII identifiers in the policy document.
