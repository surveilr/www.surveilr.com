You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

- **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
- **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
  - **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
  - **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
  - **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
- **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
  - **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
  - **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
  - **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
- **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

- **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
- **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization prohibits the use of portable storage devices in organizational information systems when such devices have no identifiable owner."
  - **Control Code:** MP.L2-3.8.8
  - **Control Question:** Does the organization prohibit the use of portable storage devices in organizational information systems when such devices have no identifiable owner?
  - **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-DCH-0010.2
- **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
  "This policy establishes the guidelines for the prohibition of portable storage devices without identifiable owners in organizational information systems. The purpose is to protect sensitive information, including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. The organization prohibits the use of portable storage devices that lack identifiable owners within its information systems. Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all personnel and systems, ensuring adherence to the control requirements outlined in CMMC Control MP.L2-3.8.8."
- **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Evidence collected includes OSquery results showing connected portable devices, along with monthly signed inventory reports by managers confirming ownership of all devices tracked. The OSquery logs detail the usage and ownership of each device connected to the systems."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - MP.L2-3.8.8

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** MP.L2-3.8.8
**Control Question:** Does the organization prohibit the use of portable storage devices in organizational information systems when such devices have no identifiable owner?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-DCH-0010.2
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization prohibits the use of portable storage devices in organizational information systems when such devices have no identifiable owner.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must ensure all portable storage devices are tracked and have identifiable owners.
    * **Provided Evidence:** OSquery results showing connected portable devices with ownership details.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery used to automate tracking of connected portable devices.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SQL query to verify ownership details against the RSSD.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence demonstrates that all portable devices are being tracked with identifiable ownership as required by the control.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Managers must attest to the device inventory reports monthly.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Monthly signed inventory reports by managers confirming ownership.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Managers sign off on device inventory.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Surveilr records these signed reports for compliance tracking.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed reports confirm that all portable storage devices are accounted for and associated with identifiable owners, fulfilling the control's requirements.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose of preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information is being met.
* **Justification:** The combination of machine and human attestations effectively supports the intent of the control.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None identified.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence is fully compliant with the control requirements, effectively demonstrating that the organization prohibits the use of portable storage devices without identifiable owners.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:** [N/A as the result is PASS]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:** [N/A as the result is PASS]
* **Required Human Action Steps:** [N/A as the result is PASS]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [N/A as the result is PASS]
