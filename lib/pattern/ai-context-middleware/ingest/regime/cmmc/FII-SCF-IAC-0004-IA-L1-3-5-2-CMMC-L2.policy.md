# Device Identification and Authentication Policy

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements for uniquely identifying and centrally authenticating devices within our organization. Effective device identification and authentication are critical for securing sensitive data and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. By implementing robust authentication measures, we aim to protect our systems from unauthorized access and potential breaches, particularly concerning electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to uniquely identifying and centrally authenticating all devices accessing our systems. This is achieved through the use of bidirectional authentication methods that are cryptographically-based and replay-resistant, ensuring a secure and trustworthy environment for all digital communications and transactions.

## Scope
This policy applies to all entities and environments within the organization, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels and methods used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team:** 
  - Implement and maintain device authentication protocols (Monthly)
  - Monitor authentication logs for anomalies (Weekly)
  - Report any security incidents to management (Immediately)

- **Compliance Officer:**
  - Oversee adherence to this policy (Quarterly)
  - Ensure all staff are trained on authentication processes (Annually)
  - Review and update the policy as necessary (Annually)

- **All Employees:** 
  - Ensure devices used for work are registered and authenticated (Ongoing)
  - Report any issues with device authentication promptly (Immediately)

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:** All devices must be uniquely identified and authenticated before establishing any network connection to the organizationâ€™s systems.
   
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   - Implement API integrations to automate evidence collection through validation of authentication logs and device inventory reports.
   - Use cryptographic signatures to verify device identity and prevent replay attacks.
   
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   - Personnel must sign off on quarterly validation reports confirming that all devices are authenticated and compliant with this policy.
   - Conduct annual training sessions and require acknowledgment of understanding from all employees regarding their responsibilities under this policy.

## Verification Criteria
To ensure compliance with this policy, the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and service level agreements (SLAs) will be established:
- 100% of devices must be registered and authenticated prior to access.
- 98% of authentication logs must be reviewed and validated monthly.
- Compliance training completion rate should be at least 95% annually.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented using the following process:
- Submit a formal request for an exception, including justification and proposed duration.
- Obtain approval from the Compliance Officer.
- Document the exception and review it during the annual policy review.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** All authentication logs and evidence must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- **Policy Review:** This policy will undergo a mandatory review and potential updates on an annual basis.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members are required to sign an acknowledgment form confirming their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions taken under this policy, including device authentication and any exceptions granted.
