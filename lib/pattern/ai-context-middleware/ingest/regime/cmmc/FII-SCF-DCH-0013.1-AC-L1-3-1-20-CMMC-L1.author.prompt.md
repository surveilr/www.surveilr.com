You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L1-3.1.20 (FII: FII-SCF-DCH-0013.1). 

The policy must follow this exact structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Each section should include:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly describe the purpose of the policy.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the policy regarding the prohibition of external parties, systems, and services from storing, processing, and transmitting data without proper authorization.
3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope, explicitly including all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Provide specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **SMART** **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (**Annual Review**).
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
10. **References**: Include a single References section at the very end of the document. Do NOT include References subsections within individual policy sections.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by providing concrete examples of automated evidence collection and validation for each requirement, while also defining explicit human attestation methods when necessary. All operational details must be **SMART** and specific, with bulleted lists of 3-5 operational steps and time-bound metrics for processes like containment and remediation. 

The policy must also emphasize the importance of **Data Retention**, **Annual Review**, and other mandated keywords by making them **bold**. 

Remember, do not include any SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code, and ensure that the final document ends with exactly ONE References section.
