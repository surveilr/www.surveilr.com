You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AU.L2-3.3.5 (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0002.1). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Each section should be structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the purpose and importance of the policy.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the policy's intent and objectives.
3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's applicability to all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems involved in ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, linking to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Explain the control requirement.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical, automatable methods for machine evidence collection (e.g., using OSquery or API integrations).
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Describe verifiable actions a human must perform, detailing the artifact and how it will be ingested into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation linked to **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting any exceptions to the policy.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Define **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and mandate an **Annual Review** frequency for policy updates.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of compliance, comprehensive audit logging, and documentation for all exceptions.

The policy must maximize machine attestability, so every section must include attestation guidance. Ensure that the policy includes **SMART** instructions and operational details, replacing general statements with specific, measurable actions. 

IMPORTANT: Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections. The document must end with exactly ONE References section, which should contain all external references used in the policy in the format [Link Text](URL). If no external references exist, state "None" in the References section.

Be sure to **BOLD** the following keywords wherever they appear in the policy: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

Follow these guidelines closely to achieve a 100% compliance score for the policy document.
