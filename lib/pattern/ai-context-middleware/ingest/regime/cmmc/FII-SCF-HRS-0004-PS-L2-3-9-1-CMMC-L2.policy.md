# Personnel Security Screening Policy

## Introduction
This policy is designed to outline the organization’s approach to managing personnel security risk through effective screening of individuals prior to granting them access to sensitive information and systems. The importance of this policy lies in its ability to protect organizational assets and ensure compliance with CMMC requirements, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to **screening** all individuals prior to authorizing access to its information systems and sensitive data. This commitment ensures that personnel security risks are effectively managed and mitigated, safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of organizational information.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who require access to the organization’s information systems, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems. It encompasses all environments where sensitive data is processed or stored.

## Responsibilities
- **HR Department**: Conduct background checks on all new hires before granting access to sensitive systems **(Before Access)**.
- **IT Security Team**: Review and validate screening results to ensure compliance with security standards **(Before Access)**.
- **Compliance Officer**: Monitor adherence to the policy and report non-compliance issues **(Monthly)**.
- **All Employees**: Complete and return signed acknowledgment forms confirming understanding of personnel security policies **(Upon Hire)**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization is required to manage personnel security risk by implementing a screening process that evaluates the background and qualifications of individuals prior to granting access.
   
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize automated background check systems that provide verifiable data on candidates within 48 hours of submission. The system should generate a report that logs screening results, timestamps, and user actions.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: HR must maintain signed acknowledgment forms from all screened individuals, confirming that they have undergone the screening process and understand the security requirements. These forms should be stored electronically for easy access and retrieval.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 100% of new hires screened before access to sensitive systems is granted.
- Background check results should be generated within 48 hours for 95% of candidates.
- Acknowledgment forms must be collected and stored for 100% of screened individuals within 5 business days of access approval.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted based on documented risk assessments and must be approved by the Compliance Officer. Documentation of the exception must include justification, the individuals involved, and the duration of the exception.

## Lifecycle Requirements
All evidence related to personnel screening, including background check results and acknowledgment forms, must be retained for a minimum of **5 years**. The policy must undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness, with updates made as necessary.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding of this policy through signed documentation. Comprehensive audit logging must be implemented for all critical actions related to personnel screening, including background checks and access approvals, to ensure traceability and accountability.
