You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
** Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization must generate event log reports to assist in identifying and assessing potential anomalous activities."
Control Code: AU.L2-3.3.6
Control Question: Does the organization provide an event log report generation capability to aid in detecting and assessing anomalous activities?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-MON-0006
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "Event log report generation is a critical component in the detection and assessment of anomalous activities within an organization's IT infrastructure. By systematically capturing and analyzing event logs from various systems, organizations can gain insights into potential security incidents, compliance violations, and operational inefficiencies. These reports serve as a foundational element for incident response, risk management, and continuous monitoring, ultimately enhancing the overall security posture. The organization mandates the generation of event log reports for all relevant systems and applications. These reports must be generated automatically and made available for review to ensure timely detection and assessment of anomalous activities."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Automated event log reports generated from Surveilr show 100% compliance with scheduled generation. Reports timestamped and stored securely. A designated member of the IT Security Team has reviewed and signed off on the reports, with documentation of the act of human attestation stored in Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AU.L2-3.3.6

**Overall Audit Result: PASS**
**Date of Audit:** 2023-10-10
**Auditor Role:** Official Auditor
**Control Code:** AU.L2-3.3.6
**Control Question:** Does the organization provide an event log report generation capability to aid in detecting and assessing anomalous activities?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-MON-0006
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization must generate event log reports to assist in identifying and assessing potential anomalous activities.

## 1. Executive Summary

The audit findings confirm that the organization effectively generates event log reports, which align with the control's requirements. The evidence indicates a robust automated logging system with human oversight, fulfilling both the literal requirements and the underlying intent of the control. The overall audit decision is a PASS, as the organization has demonstrated compliance with the control.

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization is required to implement a robust event log report generation capability that facilitates continuous monitoring of systems for anomalous behavior.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated event log reports generated from Surveilr show 100% compliance with scheduled generation.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Event log reports were generated and stored using Surveilr's automated logging capabilities.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SQL queries executed against RSSD confirmed that logs were timestamped and retrievable.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the organization has successfully implemented an automated event log generation mechanism that meets the control requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** A designated individual within the IT Security Team will review and sign off on the generated event log reports.
    * **Provided Evidence:** A designated member of the IT Security Team has reviewed and signed off on the reports, with documentation of the act of human attestation stored in Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Review and sign off on the event log reports by the IT Security Team.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The act of human attestation is recorded in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The human attestation evidence confirms that the necessary oversight is in place, supporting the automated report generation.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided demonstrates that the organization is actively monitoring for anomalous activities through effective event log report generation, aligning with the control's intent.
* **Justification:** The combination of automated and human-attested evidence shows a comprehensive approach to compliance, ensuring that both the letter and spirit of the control are met.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit established that the organization effectively generates event log reports and has established a system for human oversight. The evidence provided is sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the control requirements.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**N/A** (Overall Audit Result is "PASS")
