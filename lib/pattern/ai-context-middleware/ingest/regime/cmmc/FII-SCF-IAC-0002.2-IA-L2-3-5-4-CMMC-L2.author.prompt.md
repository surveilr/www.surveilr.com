You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: IA.L2-3.5.4 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0002.2). 

## Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**: Provide a clear overview of the policy, its purpose, and importance in ensuring replay-resistant authentication mechanisms.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to implementing automated mechanisms for replay-resistant authentication.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role involved in the policy, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format (e.g., IT Security: daily log review).

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Include detailed methods for collecting evidence of compliance:
   1. **REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement for replay-resistant authentication.
   2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to validate authentication logs and detect replay attempts").
   3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify human actions and artifacts needed when automation is impractical (e.g., "IT manager must sign quarterly review of authentication mechanisms").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for documenting them.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, along with comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

10. **References**: Include exactly ONE References section at the end of the document, following the prescribed format, and ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure that all keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are **BOLD** in the document. 

Conclude the policy document with the required References section, ensuring it is the FINAL section and contains no additional content or sections.
