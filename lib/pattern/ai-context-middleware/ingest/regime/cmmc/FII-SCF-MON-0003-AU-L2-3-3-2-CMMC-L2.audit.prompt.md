You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization configures systems to produce event logs that contain sufficient information to establish what type of event occurred, when (date and time) the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome (success or failure) of the event; and the identity of any user/subject associated with the event."
  * **Control Code:** AU.L2-3.3.2
  * **Control Question:** "Does the organization configure systems to produce event logs that contain sufficient information to, at a minimum: Establish what type of event occurred; When (date and time) the event occurred; Where the event occurred; The source of the event; The outcome (success or failure) of the event; and The identity of any user/subject associated with the event?"
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-MON-0003
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy outlines the requirements and commitments for configuring systems to produce comprehensive event logs as part of our continuous monitoring efforts. Effective event logging is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of our systems, as it allows for the detection of anomalies, supports forensic investigations, and ensures compliance with regulatory standards. By establishing a robust event logging framework, we enhance our capability to proactively manage risks associated with information security."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Event logs collected from the centralized logging solution show that logs contain details such as event type, timestamp, source, outcome, and user identity. Additionally, monthly log reviews were documented and uploaded to Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AU.L2-3.3.2

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** AU.L2-3.3.2
**Control Question:** "Does the organization configure systems to produce event logs that contain sufficient information to, at a minimum: Establish what type of event occurred; When (date and time) the event occurred; Where the event occurred; The source of the event; The outcome (success or failure) of the event; and The identity of any user/subject associated with the event?"
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-MON-0003
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization configures systems to produce event logs that contain sufficient information to establish what type of event occurred, when (date and time) the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome (success or failure) of the event; and the identity of any user/subject associated with the event."

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Event logs must include sufficient information to establish the type of event, timestamp, location, source, outcome, and user identity.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Logs collected from the centralized logging solution show all required details.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Centralized logging solution utilizing automated data ingestion to collect logs.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SQL query to verify completeness of logs against the standard schema in RSSD.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided evidence meets all requirements as it captures and verifies all necessary event details.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Monthly log reviews must be documented and uploaded to Surveilr.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Documentation of monthly log reviews uploaded to Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Managers reviewed logs for completeness and accuracy.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Surveilr recorded the upload of the review results.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The monthly review process is documented and aligns with the control's requirements.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The organization has established a robust event logging framework, effectively capturing and reviewing all necessary event information.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The organization has successfully configured systems to produce event logs that meet the specified requirements, with adequate documentation of compliance through both machine and human attestations.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")
