# Internal Audit Function Policy

## 1. Introduction
The internal audit function is a critical component of technology and information governance within our organization. It serves to provide independent and objective evaluations of governance processes, ensuring that controls are effective and aligned with organizational objectives. The internal audit function not only enhances compliance with regulatory requirements but also fosters a culture of accountability and continuous improvement, thereby safeguarding the integrity of our information systems.

Our organization is committed to establishing and maintaining a robust internal audit function that effectively monitors compliance with technology and information governance standards. This function will provide assurance to senior management regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of our governance processes.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through clear and measurable criteria, including:
- **KPI for Audit Frequency:** Internal audits must be conducted quarterly.
- **SLA for Reporting:** Audit reports must be generated within two weeks following the completion of the audit.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and submitted for approval. Justifications for exceptions should include detailed reasoning and be reviewed by the Compliance Officer prior to approval.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements

- **Annual Review:** This policy will undergo an annual review to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.
