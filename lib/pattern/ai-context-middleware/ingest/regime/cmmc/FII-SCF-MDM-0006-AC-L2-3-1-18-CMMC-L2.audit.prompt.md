You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization restricts the connection of personally-owned mobile devices to its systems and networks to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the integrity of organizational assets."
  * **Control Code:** AC.L2-3.1.18
  * **Control Question:** Does the organization restrict the connection of personally-owned, mobile devices to organizational systems and networks?
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-MDM-0006
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy outlines the requirements for restricting the connection of personally-owned mobile devices to organizational systems and networks. The organization restricts the connection of personally-owned mobile devices to its systems and networks. Only authorized devices that adhere to established security configurations will be permitted access. This policy ensures protection against data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** 
    "MDM logs showing no unauthorized device connections within the last 30 days; Mobile Device Policy Acknowledgment Forms for all employees submitted; automated alerts for unauthorized device connection attempts have been implemented."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AC.L2-3.1.18

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** CMMC Auditor
**Control Code:** AC.L2-3.1.18
**Control Question:** Does the organization restrict the connection of personally-owned, mobile devices to organizational systems and networks?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-MDM-0006
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization restricts the connection of personally-owned mobile devices to its systems and networks to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the integrity of organizational assets.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Restrict personally-owned mobile devices from connecting to organizational networks.
    * **Provided Evidence:** MDM logs showing no unauthorized device connections within the last 30 days.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Utilized MDM solutions to enforce device compliance and collect logs of connected devices.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM MDM_Logs WHERE connection_status = 'unauthorized' AND connection_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY);
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided MDM logs confirm that there were no unauthorized device connections within the specified timeframe, demonstrating adherence to the control requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Employees must complete and submit a Mobile Device Policy Acknowledgment Form.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Mobile Device Policy Acknowledgment Forms for all employees submitted.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Surveilr ingested signed acknowledgment forms prior to device connection.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Acknowledgment_Forms WHERE submission_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY);
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** All employees have submitted the required acknowledgment forms, indicating compliance with the policy.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Employees must report unauthorized device attempts.
    * **Provided Evidence:** No reports of unauthorized device attempts were logged.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Employees are expected to report any unauthorized device attempts immediately.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Surveilr records reports and incidents related to unauthorized access.
    * **Compliance Status:** INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
    * **Justification:** While no unauthorized attempts were reported, the absence of evidence does not confirm the effectiveness of the reporting mechanism. Further documentation or assurance is needed.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided demonstrates that the organization is effectively restricting personally-owned mobile devices from connecting to its networks.
* **Justification:** The MDM logs and acknowledgment forms align with the control's intent to safeguard sensitive information.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** The lack of reported unauthorized attempts raises questions about the effectiveness of the reporting process, indicating a potential gap in employee engagement or awareness.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence collected demonstrates compliance with the control requirements. The organization has successfully implemented measures to restrict unauthorized device connections and has ensured employee acknowledgment of the policy.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [If applicable, specify missing evidence.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [If applicable, specify corrections needed.]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [If applicable, specify actions needed.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [Outline the process for re-submission of the corrected/missing evidence for re-evaluation.]
