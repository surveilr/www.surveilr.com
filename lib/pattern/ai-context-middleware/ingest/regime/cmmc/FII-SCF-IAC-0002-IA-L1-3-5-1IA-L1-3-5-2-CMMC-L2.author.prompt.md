You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: IA.L1-3.5.1, IA.L1-3.5.2 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0002). 

Please ensure the policy document follows this exact structure:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the policy and its importance in the context of Identification & Authentication.
   
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly define the organization’s stance on user identification, authentication, authorization, and auditing.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to manage user identities.

4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role involved, such as the Compliance Officer and IT Security personnel.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, emphasizing machine attestability.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Describe specific actions and artifacts required for human attestation, including how they will be documented and ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation that are directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the frequency for policy **Annual Review**.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgement of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a single References section at the very end of the document, using the format [Link Text](URL) for any external references. Ensure no References subsections appear after each policy section.

Remember to maximize machine attestability, include SMART instructions, and ensure all keywords — **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** — are **BOLD** in the text. 

Do not include SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code, and ensure the document ends with exactly ONE References section.
