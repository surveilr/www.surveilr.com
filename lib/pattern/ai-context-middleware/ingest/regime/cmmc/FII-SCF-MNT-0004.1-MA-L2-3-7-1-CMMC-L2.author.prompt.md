You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: MA.L2-3.7.1 (FII: FII-SCF-MNT-0004.1). 

The policy document must include the following sections in the precise order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections and that the document concludes with exactly ONE References section.

Each section should be structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the control requirement, including its relevance to compliance.

2. **Policy Statement**: State the organization's policy regarding the inspection of maintenance tools.

3. **Scope**: Clearly define the scope, including all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role involved, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format. Explicitly link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings for each requirement:
     - "1. REQUIREMENT:"
     - "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:"
     - "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:"
   - For **Machine Attestation**, describe practical methods for automated evidence collection, ensuring maximum machine attestability.
   - For **Human Attestation**, outline precise steps and required artifacts for documentation in Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Detail any exceptions to the policy and the process for documenting them.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the **Annual Review** frequency for policy updates.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure to emphasize that all enforced keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are **BOLD** in the text. The policy must be clear, robust, and primarily machine-attestable through Surveilr.
