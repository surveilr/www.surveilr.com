You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization controls and restricts access to digital and non-digital media to authorized individuals."
Control Code: AC.L2-3.1.3,  
Control Question: "Does the organization control and restrict access to digital and non-digital media to authorized individuals?"  
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-DCH-0003
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines and procedures for controlling and restricting access to both digital and non-digital media within the organization. This policy aligns with Control: AC.L2-3.1.3, which mandates that access to sensitive media be limited to authorized personnel only. Effective implementation of this control is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining compliance with the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) framework."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Access logs for digital media monitored via OSquery; role-based access controls in place; signed access control approval forms for new media items; quarterly access reviews documented with signatures from the IT Security Manager."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AC.L2-3.1.3

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** AC.L2-3.1.3
**Control Question:** "Does the organization control and restrict access to digital and non-digital media to authorized individuals?"
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-DCH-0003
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization controls and restricts access to digital and non-digital media to authorized individuals."

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Access to digital and non-digital media must be restricted to authorized individuals only.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Access logs for digital media monitored via OSquery.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery to monitor access logs for digital media.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM access_logs WHERE media_type = 'digital' AND access_time BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-07-28';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence shows that access logs are actively monitored, demonstrating adherence to the control requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Role-based access controls (RBAC) in all systems handling ePHI.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Role-based access controls implemented and functioning.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Implementation of RBAC across systems.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM user_access WHERE role IN ('authorized') AND media_type = 'ePHI';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The implementation of RBAC ensures that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive media, fulfilling the control's requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Signed access control approval forms for each new media item.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Scanned signed access control approval forms available.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Data Owner signs the approval form for access control.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Documents stored in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed forms provide adequate evidence of compliance, demonstrating that access control is managed properly.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Quarterly reviews of access permissions documented.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Quarterly review reports signed by the IT Security Manager.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Quarterly reviews conducted by the IT Security Manager.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Reports stored in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The quarterly review documentation confirms that access is consistently evaluated, meeting the control's intent.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The combination of machine-attestable and human-attested evidence shows a robust system for managing access to sensitive media, aligning with the control's requirements.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None identified.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence provided successfully meets the requirements and intent of the control, demonstrating that access to digital and non-digital media is effectively restricted to authorized individuals.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**  
* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**  
    * [For each missing piece of evidence identified in Section 2, state *exactly* what is needed. E.g., "Missing current firewall rule sets from production firewalls (FII-XYZ-001) for the quarter ending 2025-06-30."]
    * [Specify the required format/type for each missing piece: e.g., "Obtain OSquery results for network interface configurations on all servers tagged 'production_web'.", "Provide a signed PDF of the latest incident response plan approval."]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**  
    * [For each instance of non-compliant evidence identified in Section 2, clearly state *why* it is non-compliant and what *specific correction* is required. E.g., "Provided access logs show unapproved access event on 2025-07-15 by UserID 123; requires an associated incident ticket (IR-2025-005) or justification."]
    * [Specify the action needed: e.g., "Remediate firewall rule CC6-0010-005 to correctly block traffic from IP range X.Y.Z.0/24.", "Provide evidence of user access review completion for Q2 2025 for all critical systems."]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
