You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.3 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0008). 

The policy must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and significance.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to enforcing a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policy for sensitive/regulated data access.
3. **Scope**: Define the comprehensive scope of the policy, explicitly including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Assign specific task-level duties, using **Action Verbs + Frequency** for each role involved in the RBAC policy enforcement.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Explain the need for a Role-Based Access Control policy.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical methods for automated evidence collection (e.g., using API integrations to verify access controls).
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Outline necessary human actions and artifacts for attestation (e.g., signed access review logs).
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the previous section.
7. **Exceptions**: Define any exceptions to the policy and the process for their approval.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include data retention periods for logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review (e.g., **Annual Review**).
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.
10. **References**: Conclude the document with a single **References** section, which should contain only external references in the format [Link Text](URL). 

Ensure that no References subsections appear after each policy section and that the policy document ends with exactly ONE References section. Remember to use **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, and to **BOLD** all enforced keywords throughout the document.
