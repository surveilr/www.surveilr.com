You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AU.L2-3.3.1, AU.L2-3.3.3, AU.L2-3.3.5, AU.L2-3.3.6, AU.L2-3.3.8, AU.L2-3.3.9 (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0002). 

The policy document must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** 

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy, its purpose, and importance in the context of continuous monitoring.
   
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the policy regarding the use of automated tools for log collection and monitoring.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope explicitly to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Detail the **specific, task-level duties (Action Verb + Frequency)** for each role involved, linking to related organizational plans as necessary.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings per requirement: 
     - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Explain the control requirement.
     - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
     - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Describe precise steps and artifacts for human attestation when automation is impractical.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation that are directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting any exceptions to the policy.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy **Annual Review**.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by including attestation guidance in every section. Do not include References subsections within policy sections; the References section must appear only at the very end of the document. Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code where appropriate. The final section should be labeled "### References" and include only relevant external references or "None" if there are no references. 

**IMPORTANT**: The policy must include **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** as **bolded** keywords throughout the document. 

Output the policy with these requirements strictly followed, ensuring clarity and compliance with regulatory standards.
