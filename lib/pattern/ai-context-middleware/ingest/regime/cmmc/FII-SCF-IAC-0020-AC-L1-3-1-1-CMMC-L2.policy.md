# Logical Access Control Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for enforcing Logical Access Control (LAC) permissions within the organization in alignment with the principle of "least privilege." This principle ensures that individuals have only the access necessary to perform their job functions, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems. By adhering to this policy, the organization can enhance its security posture, protect sensitive data, and comply with regulatory requirements.

## Policy Statement
The organization mandates that all access to information systems and resources is controlled based on the "least privilege" principle. Access permissions will be granted strictly based on job responsibilities and the necessity to perform assigned tasks. All personnel must comply with this policy to ensure that access controls are effectively implemented and maintained.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors (Business Associates) who access the organization's information systems, including but not limited to cloud-hosted environments, SaaS applications, and on-premises systems. It encompasses all devices, applications, and services utilized within the organization.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and approve access requests **Monthly**; conduct policy reviews and updates **Annually**.
- **IT Security**: Implement access controls based on policy requirements **Upon User Onboarding and Role Changes**; monitor access logs for anomalies **Daily**.
- **Department Managers**: Evaluate and validate access needs for their teams **Quarterly**; submit access modification requests **As Needed**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**:
   The organization shall enforce logical access control permissions by regularly validating user access rights against defined job functions, ensuring compliance with the least privilege principle.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**:
   Automatable methods for evidence collection include:
   - API integrations with cloud/SaaS providers to automate the validation of user access permissions.
   - Scheduled queries against asset inventories to verify that access controls are aligned with current user roles.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**:
   To ensure compliance, a human must:
   - Review user access permissions **Quarterly**.
   - Document findings in a standardized report.
   - Ingest this evidence into Surveilr by uploading the report and tagging it with relevant metadata (e.g., date, reviewer name) for audit purposes.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following criteria:
- Percentage of users with access rights aligned with their job roles (target: 100%).
- Number of access violations identified during monitoring activities (target: 0).
- Timeliness of access reviews conducted as per the defined frequency.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. The process for requesting an exception includes:
- Submission of a written request outlining the rationale for the exception.
- Review by the Compliance Officer and IT Security.
- Documentation of the decision and any conditions associated with the exception.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to access control must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an annual review to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through formal attestation. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for all critical actions related to access control, and all exceptions must be formally documented.
