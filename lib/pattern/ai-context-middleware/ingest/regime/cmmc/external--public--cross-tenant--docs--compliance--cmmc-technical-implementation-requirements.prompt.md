# Technical Implementation of CMMC Requirements - ESPs, Asset Categories, and VDI

## What are the key technical considerations for implementing CMMC requirements?

The Technical Implementation of CMMC Requirements covers critical operational aspects of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification program, focusing on External Service Providers (ESPs), asset categorization, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), and specialized asset management. These technical implementation details determine how organizations scope their assessments, manage third-party services, and handle different asset types within their CMMC compliance framework.

**Primary Focus Areas**: ESP scoping requirements, Security Protection Assets (SPAs) and Security Protection Data (SPD) management, VDI configurations, and asset category differences between CMMC levels.

## External Service Provider (ESP) Scoping Framework

**ESP Definition**: External companies providing services to organizations seeking CMMC assessment, including Managed Service Providers (MSPs), Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

**Scoping Decision Matrix**:

### When ESP Processes, Stores, or Transmits CUI:

**Cloud Service Providers**: Must meet FedRAMP Moderate or equivalent requirements per DFARS 252.204-7012
**Non-Cloud ESPs**: Services fall within Organization Seeking Assessment (OSA) scope and must be assessed as part of OSA's assessment

### When ESP Handles Only Security Protection Data:

**Both CSPs and Non-CSPs**: Services included in OSA assessment scope and assessed as Security Protection Assets

### When ESP Handles Neither CUI nor SPD:

**All ESPs**: Do not meet CMMC definition of ESP and are out of scope

## Cloud Service Provider vs. Managed Service Provider Distinctions

**Clear CSP Indicators**:

- Company markets itself as "__aaS" (Something-as-a-Service)
- Subscription-based service with rapid provisioning capabilities
- Customer can independently make changes and spin up/down resources

**Clear Non-CSP Indicators**:

- Hardware hosting in colocation or datacenter
- Data hosting similar to shared drives on local networks
- Traditional IT staff augmentation services

**Gray Area Determination**:

- Depends on relationships between CSP, MSP, and OSA
- MSP becomes CSP if they own cloud tenant and sub-divide for customers
- Must be documented and described in System Security Plan (SSP)

## Security Protection Assets (SPAs) and Security Protection Data (SPD)

**Security Protection Assets**: Assets providing security functions or capabilities to the OSA's CMMC Assessment Scope, including SIEM systems, vulnerability scanners, and EDR solutions.

**Security Protection Data**: Data stored or processed by SPAs used to protect the assessed environment, including:

- Configuration data required to operate SPAs
- Log files generated by or ingested by SPAs
- Asset configuration and vulnerability status data
- Administrative passwords for in-scope environments

**Key Update**: ESPs that only store SPD or provide SPAs without processing CUI do NOT require separate CMMC assessment or FedRAMP authorization.

## Asset Category Requirements by CMMC Level

### Level 2 Security Protection Assets:

**OSA Requirements**:

- Document in asset inventory
- Document asset treatment in SSP
- Include in network diagram of CMMC Assessment Scope
- Prepare for CMMC Level 2 assessment

**Assessment Requirements**: Assess against Level 2 security requirements relevant to capabilities provided

### Level 3 Security Protection Assets:

**Enhanced Requirements**: Same documentation requirements as Level 2 plus preparation for both Level 2 and Level 3 assessments
**Assessment Requirements**: Limited check against Level 2, full assessment against all relevant Level 3 requirements

## Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Configuration

**Out-of-Scope Classification**: VDI endpoints configured to prevent CUI processing, storage, or transmission beyond Keyboard/Video/Mouse data are considered Out-of-Scope Assets.

**Acceptable Configurations**:

- Use of tokens/certificates for authentication is permitted
- Properly configured to prevent CUI handling beyond KVM
- Subject to assessor verification of configuration

**Non-Compliant VDI**: Improperly configured VDI systems that allow CUI processing are treated as CUI assets requiring full assessment.

## Specialized Assets and Contractor Risk Managed Assets (CRMAs)

**Specialized Assets**: Assets that can process CUI but cannot be fully secured, including IoT devices, IIoT devices, Operational Technology (OT), Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), and Test Equipment.

**Level 2 Treatment**: Document in inventory and SSP showing risk-based management; no assessment against other CMMC requirements
**Level 3 Treatment**: Full documentation plus limited Level 2 check and complete Level 3 assessment

**Contractor Risk Managed Assets (CRMAs)**:

- Assets that CAN but are NOT INTENDED to process CUI due to security policies and practices
- Level 2: No assessment if sufficiently documented in SSP
- Level 3: CRMAs become CUI Assets requiring full assessment if in same scope

## ESP Service Categories and CMMC Implications

**Staff Augmentation Services**: IT help desk, onsite technicians, fractional CIO/CISO services - treated as OSA staff with SPD considerations for administrative passwords

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Physical servers, RDS environments, tailored VDI - included in assessment scope if processing CUI, with scoping boundaries dependent on isolation degree

**Managed Security Services**: SOC operations, incident response - treated as SPAs with specific Level 2 or Level 3 assessment requirements based on CMMC level

## Key Implementation Guidance

**Documentation Requirements**: All ESPs and asset categories require comprehensive documentation in asset inventory, SSP, and network diagrams
**Assessment Preparation**: Organizations must prepare ESPs and assets for assessment according to their specific CMMC level requirements
**Risk Management**: CRMAs require clear documentation of risk-based security policies to avoid full assessment requirements

This technical framework ensures defense contractors properly scope their CMMC assessments while effectively managing the complex relationships between internal systems, external service providers, and various asset categories within their cybersecurity compliance programs.
