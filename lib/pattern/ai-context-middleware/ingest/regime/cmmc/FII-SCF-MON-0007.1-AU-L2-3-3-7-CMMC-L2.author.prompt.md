You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AU.L2-3.3.7 (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0007.1). 

Please follow the structure outlined below for the policy document:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly explain the purpose of the policy and its importance in ensuring compliance with time synchronization requirements.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to synchronizing internal system clocks with an authoritative time source.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, explicitly including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: 
   - Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in implementing and maintaining this policy. 

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: State the requirement for clock synchronization.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe practical methods for automated evidence collection, such as using logs from time synchronization services or verifying configurations via OSquery.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify actions a human must perform, such as periodic reviews or certifications related to time synchronization.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation that directly tie to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for requesting them.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify the **Data Retention** period for evidence/logs (e.g., retain for 6 years) and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: 
   - Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance.
   - Mandate comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions (creation, modification, termination).
   - Specify formal documentation for all exceptions (justification, duration, approval).

10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document, using the format [Link Text](URL) for any external references. Ensure that no References subsections appear after individual policy sections.

Emphasize that every policy section must include attestation guidance, ensuring maximum machine attestability. The use of bold text for the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** is mandatory. 

End the policy document with exactly ONE References section. Do not include References subsections within the individual sections of the policy.
