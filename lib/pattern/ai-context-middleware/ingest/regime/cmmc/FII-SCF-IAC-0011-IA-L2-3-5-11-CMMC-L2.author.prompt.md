You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: IA.L2-3.5.11 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0011).

## Policy Document Structure
1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the importance of obscuring authentication feedback to protect against exploitation.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to obscuring authentication feedback during the authentication process.
3. **Scope**: Define the scope to include all relevant systems, applications, and personnel involved in the authentication process.
4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties (with **Action Verb + Frequency**) for roles such as Compliance Officer and IT Security.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement to obscure authentication feedback.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automated methods for ensuring feedback obscuration, such as logging authentication attempts and validating feedback mechanisms.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define the steps a human must take, including documentation and review processes.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish measurable compliance criteria related to the obscuration of authentication feedback.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline any allowable exceptions to the policy and the process for requesting them.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify **Data Retention** periods for logs and evidence, and the **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Explain the requirements for workforce member acknowledgment/attestation and comprehensive audit logging of actions taken.
10. **References**: This section should include a list of all external sources referenced in the document, using the format [Link Text](URL). 

Ensure that the policy sections do not include References subsections within them and that the document ends with exactly ONE References section. Emphasize the importance of **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the policy.
