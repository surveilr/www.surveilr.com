You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To restrict the use of types of digital media on systems or system components to mitigate risks associated with data breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance violations."
  * **Control Code:** MP.L2-3.8.7
  * **Control Question:** "Does the organization restrict the use of types of digital media on systems or system components?"
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-DCH-0010
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The organization establishes guidelines for the use of digital media to ensure secure handling of sensitive data. Unauthorized types of digital media are strictly restricted on systems and components to prevent risks associated with data breaches."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Weekly digital media usage logs collected via OSquery, quarterly signed compliance reports from IT manager, incident reports indicating zero unauthorized digital media usage incidents."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - MP.L2-3.8.7

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** MP.L2-3.8.7
**Control Question:** Does the organization restrict the use of types of digital media on systems or system components?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-DCH-0010
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To restrict the use of types of digital media on systems or system components to mitigate risks associated with data breaches.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must restrict the use of unauthorized types of digital media on systems or system components.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Weekly digital media usage logs collected via OSquery.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery for collecting digital media usage logs.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM digital_media_logs WHERE usage_date >= '2025-01-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided logs demonstrate adherence to the control requirements through automated collection and reporting.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Compliance confirmation through quarterly signed reports from the IT manager.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Quarterly signed compliance reports from IT manager.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Human attestation recorded as a signed PDF.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The quarterly signed report confirms compliance actions taken regarding unauthorized usage, supporting the control's intent.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Zero incidents of unauthorized digital media usage.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Incident reports indicating zero unauthorized digital media usage incidents.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Manual review of incident logs.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Records of incident report completion.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence indicates that no unauthorized digital media incidents occurred, confirming adherence to the control's intent.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met effectively.
* **Justification:** The combination of machine and human attestation methods confirms both compliance and an active approach to maintaining digital media security.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** No critical gaps identified.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence provided met all requirements set forth by the control, demonstrating both machine and human attestation methods effectively support the organization's compliance posture.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [N/A as the overall result is PASS]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [N/A as the overall result is PASS]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [N/A as the overall result is PASS]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [N/A as the overall result is PASS]
