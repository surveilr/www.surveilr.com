# Identification and Authentication Policy

## 1. Introduction
This policy outlines the organization's commitment to ensuring compliance with the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) requirements, specifically Control IA.L1-3.5.1 and IA.L1-3.5.2. The importance of this policy lies in its role in uniquely identifying and centrally authenticating, authorizing, and auditing organizational users and processes. By implementing robust identification and authentication mechanisms, the organization can protect sensitive information, including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), and maintain trust with stakeholders.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to uniquely identifying and centrally authenticating, authorizing, and auditing all users and processes that access its systems. This commitment ensures that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information and that all actions are traceable for accountability.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: **Quarterly** policy approval; ensure alignment with CMMC requirements.
- **IT Security**: **Daily** log review; monitor user access and authentication logs.
- **System Administrators**: **Weekly** user access audits; ensure proper configuration of authentication mechanisms.
- **HR Department**: **As needed**; notify IT Security of personnel changes affecting access rights.

All roles must adhere to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: 
   - Users must be uniquely identified using assigned usernames.
   - Authentication must be performed using strong passwords or multi-factor authentication.
   - Authorization must be role-based, ensuring users have access only to necessary resources.
   - Auditing must capture all access and authentication events.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
   - Use **OSquery** to collect user authentication logs **daily**.
   - Implement automated scripts to verify compliance with authentication requirements.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
   - The IT manager must sign off on the **quarterly** user access review report.
   - Document any exceptions in user access rights and maintain records for audit purposes.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following **SMART** criteria:
- **Specific**: 100% of users must have unique identifiers.
- **Measurable**: Authentication logs must be reviewed **daily** with no unauthorized access attempts.
- **Achievable**: All users must complete training on authentication processes **annually**.
- **Relevant**: Access rights must be reviewed and updated **quarterly**.
- **Time-bound**: All evidence must be collected and reported within specified timeframes.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. The process for approval includes:
- Submission of an exception request form.
- Review and assessment of the impact on security.
- Documentation of the exception in the policy records.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy must be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure continued compliance and relevance.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging must be maintained for all critical actions, and formal documentation must be created for all exceptions to the policy.
