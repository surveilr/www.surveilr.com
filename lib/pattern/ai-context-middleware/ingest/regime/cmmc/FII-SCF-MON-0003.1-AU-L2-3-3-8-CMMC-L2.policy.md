## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the protection of sensitive and regulated data contained within log files. In an increasingly digital landscape, safeguarding this data is crucial for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of organizational assets. Effective log file management is essential not only for compliance with regulatory requirements but also for ensuring the trust of stakeholders and the protection of the organizationâ€™s reputation.

## 2. Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to protecting sensitive and regulated data within log files through comprehensive monitoring, access controls, and regular audits. We recognize that log files can contain critical information that, if compromised, could lead to significant risks. Therefore, we will implement necessary measures to ensure that this data is adequately safeguarded against unauthorized access, alteration, and disclosure.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all relevant entities and environments within the organization, including but not limited to:
