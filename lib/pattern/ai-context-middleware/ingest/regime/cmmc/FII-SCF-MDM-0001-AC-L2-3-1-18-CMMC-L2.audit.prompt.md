You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

- **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
- **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
  - **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
  - **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
  - **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
- **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
  - **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
  - **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
  - **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
- **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

- **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
- **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To enforce the implementation and governance of Mobile Device Management (MDM) controls to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI)."
  - **Control Code:** AC.L2-3.1.18
  - **Control Question:** Does the organization implement and govern Mobile Device Management (MDM) controls?
  - **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-MDM-0001
- **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):** 
  "The organization has established comprehensive controls for Mobile Device Management (MDM) to protect ePHI by ensuring all mobile devices accessing organizational resources are properly managed and secured. The organization mandates the deployment of MDM solutions to enforce security policies and monitor compliance, applicable to all personnel utilizing mobile devices."
- **Provided Evidence for Audit:** 
  "Automated compliance checks conducted by MDM software indicate that 92% of mobile devices are compliant with encryption and security patch levels. Compliance attestation forms submitted by 85% of employees who attended MDM training sessions are recorded in Surveilr. Non-compliance logs have been documented by the IT Security Team."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AC.L2-3.1.18

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** CMMC Auditor
**Control Code:** AC.L2-3.1.18
**Control Question:** Does the organization implement and govern Mobile Device Management (MDM) controls?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-MDM-0001
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To enforce the implementation and governance of Mobile Device Management (MDM) controls to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI).

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must implement MDM solutions that enforce security policies on all mobile devices accessing ePHI.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated compliance checks conducted by MDM software indicate that 92% of mobile devices are compliant with encryption and security patch levels.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** MDM software conducts automated compliance checks via device logs.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM device_compliance_logs WHERE compliance_status = 'Compliant';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence shows that the majority of mobile devices are compliant with established security policies, thus meeting the control requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Employees must complete and submit a compliance attestation form via Surveilr after attending MDM training sessions.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Compliance attestation forms submitted by 85% of employees who attended MDM training sessions are recorded in Surveilr.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Surveilr records digital signatures and compliance forms submitted by employees.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence of completed compliance forms supports the requirement for training compliance.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The IT Security Team must document any instances of non-compliance and remediation efforts in Surveilr.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Non-compliance logs have been documented by the IT Security Team.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** The IT Security Team recorded non-compliance instances and remedial actions taken.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Surveilr tracks non-compliance logs and remediation efforts.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** Documented non-compliance logs demonstrate that the IT Security Team is actively monitoring and addressing compliance issues.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** Based on the totality of the provided evidence, the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The evidence aligns with the spirit of the control by demonstrating proactive management of mobile devices and ensuring compliance through both automated and human attestations.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit findings indicate that the organization is effectively implementing MDM controls, with significant compliance rates for both machine attestable and human attestation evidence.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
