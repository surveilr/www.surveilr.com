# Continuous Monitoring Policy for Log Collection and Monitoring

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements for the centralized collection and monitoring of security-related event logs utilizing automated tools, specifically through the implementation of a Security Incident Event Manager (SIEM) or similar technologies. The purpose of this policy is to ensure continuous monitoring of security events, thereby enhancing the organization's ability to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents. Effective log management is crucial for compliance with regulatory standards and for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.

## Policy Statement
The organization shall utilize automated tools, such as a SIEM, to facilitate the centralized collection, analysis, and monitoring of security-related event logs. This policy mandates that all relevant logs be collected in a machine-attestable format to support continuous monitoring and compliance verification.

## Scope
This policy applies to all systems and environments that process, store, or transmit sensitive information, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems

## Responsibilities
- **Security Team**: 
  - **Monitor** security logs daily to identify anomalies and threats.
  - **Report** findings to management weekly, ensuring timely communication of incidents.
  
- **IT Operations**: 
  - **Configure** SIEM tools monthly to ensure comprehensive log collection.
  - **Maintain** system integrity by conducting quarterly audits of log data.

- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - **Review** compliance with this policy annually and provide recommendations for improvements.
  - **Document** exceptions to policy requirements as they arise.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. AU.L2-3.3.1: Automated Tools for Event Logs
- **REQUIREMENT**: Ensure centralized collection of security-related event logs using automated tools.
- **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize SIEM to automatically collect log data and generate reports on a scheduled basis.
- **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Conduct a manual review of the automated logs monthly to ensure completeness and accuracy, documenting any discrepancies.

### 2. AU.L2-3.3.3: Log Retention and Protection
- **REQUIREMENT**: Logs must be retained securely for a defined period.
- **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Implement automated retention policies within the SIEM that enforce data retention periods.
- **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Conduct biannual reviews of log retention settings and confirm adherence to retention policies through documented checklists.

### 3. AU.L2-3.3.5: Log Monitoring
- **REQUIREMENT**: Regular monitoring of logs for suspicious activities.
- **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Set automated alerts for predefined security events.
- **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Maintain a logbook of manual monitoring activities, including the date, time, and findings of any anomalies.

### 4. AU.L2-3.3.6: Incident Response
- **REQUIREMENT**: Establish procedures for responding to security incidents identified through logs.
- **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automate incident reporting through the SIEM.
- **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Document response activities and outcomes in an incident response log for each security event.

### 5. AU.L2-3.3.8: Event Log Integrity
- **REQUIREMENT**: Ensure the integrity of logs collected.
- **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Use hashing techniques to verify log integrity automatically.
- **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Periodically review hash values and logs for integrity verification and document the findings.

### 6. AU.L2-3.3.9: Log Review
- **REQUIREMENT**: Conduct regular reviews of collected logs.
- **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Schedule automated log reviews weekly through the SIEM.
- **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Provide written summaries of log reviews to the Security Team, including any identified issues.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 100% of security logs must be collected and processed by the SIEM.
- Anomalies must be identified and reported within 24 hours.
- 95% of logs should be reviewed monthly.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented in writing and approved by the Compliance Officer. Each exception will include the rationale for the deviation and any compensatory controls that will be implemented.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All logs and evidence must be retained for a minimum of **two years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy shall be reviewed and updated at least once every **12 months** to ensure ongoing compliance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions taken in relation to security logs must be maintained, ensuring traceability and accountability.
