You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: IR.L2-3.6.3 (FII: FII-SCF-IRO-0006). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy **MUST** contain the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections; they should only appear at the very end of the document.

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like incident response testing, include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps (e.g., "Conduct a tabletop exercise, evaluate participant performance, document findings, update response plans, and schedule the next exercise") along with a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)** (e.g., "Complete exercises biannually").

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems**, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation methods.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Where necessary, define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Clearly define **specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency)** for each role mentioned in the Responsibilities section. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan).

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing **minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the **mandatory frequency for policy review and update** (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require **workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, **comprehensive audit logging** for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions (justification, duration, approval).

9. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

10. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined.

11. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

12. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

13. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text **MUST** explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

14. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section** of the policy document. After this section, output nothing elseâ€”no control identifiers, metadata, or additional content. 

15. **References Section Format**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

By following these guidelines, create a policy that ensures compliance with CMMC requirements while maximizing machine attestability through Surveilr.
