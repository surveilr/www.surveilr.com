You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AU.L2-3.3.9 (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0008.2). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. 

1. **Introduction**: Clearly describe the purpose of the policy in relation to restricting access to the management of event logs. 

2. **Policy Statement**: State the organization's commitment to restricting access to event log management to only those privileged users with a specific business need. 

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems. 

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in event log management. Explicitly link these duties to related organizational plans.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use the mandatory structure:
     - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement.
     - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, emphasizing the use of Surveilr.
     - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define precise actions, artifacts, and how they will be documented and ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting any exceptions to the policy, including justification, duration, and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Please ensure that all sections include attestation guidance, and avoid including References subsections within the policy sections. The document must end with exactly ONE References section, where external references will be listed in the format [Link Text](URL). 

**IMPORTANT**: The policy MUST maximize machine attestability, and all instructions must replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. All enforced keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** must be **BOLD** within the text. 

Do not include control identifiers, control questions, or FII IDs in the output.
