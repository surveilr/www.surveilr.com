You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization employs Network Intrusion Detection / Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS) to detect and/or prevent intrusions into the network."
Control Code : SI.L2-3.14.6,
Control Question : "Does the organization employ Network Intrusion Detection / Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS) to detect and/or prevent intrusions into the network?"
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-NET-0008
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish the framework for employing Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS) within the organization. These systems play a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive information by continuously monitoring network traffic for anomalies and potential threats. The organization is committed to employing NIDS/NIPS as a proactive measure to detect and prevent intrusions into the network, providing real-time alerts on suspicious activities."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "NIDS/NIPS logs integrated into Surveilr for continuous monitoring, incident reports generated by IT Security Personnel, signed reports from Network Security Personnel verifying system configurations and logs monthly."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - SI.L2-3.14.6

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** SI.L2-3.14.6
**Control Question:** Does the organization employ Network Intrusion Detection / Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS) to detect and/or prevent intrusions into the network?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-NET-0008
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization employs Network Intrusion Detection / Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS) to detect and/or prevent intrusions into the network.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must employ NIDS/NIPS to continuously monitor and protect the network environment.
    * **Provided Evidence:** NIDS/NIPS logs integrated into Surveilr.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion via API calls to collect NIDS/NIPS logs.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM NIDS_logs WHERE incident_detected = 'true'; (conceptual query).
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided NIDS/NIPS logs demonstrate effective monitoring of the network environment per the control requirement.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Network security personnel must provide a signed report verifying system configuration and logs.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed reports from Network Security Personnel verifying system configurations and logs monthly.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Signed verification of system configurations by security personnel.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Evidence stored in Surveilr as signed PDF documents.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed reports provide adequate human attestation confirming the configurations and logs required by the control.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent  Spirit

* **Assessment:** Yes, the provided evidence meets the control's intent and spirit. NIDS/NIPS are actively employed and monitored with both machine and human attestations in place.
* **Justification:** The integration of NIDS/NIPS logs with Surveilr and the signed reports from personnel adequately demonstrate compliance with the control's objectives. 

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The organization employs NIDS/NIPS effectively, with both machine-attestable and human-attestable evidence confirming compliance. All requirements of the control have been met satisfactorily.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:** [Not applicable as the result is PASS]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:** [Not applicable as the result is PASS]
* **Required Human Action Steps:** [Not applicable as the result is PASS]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [Not applicable as the result is PASS]
