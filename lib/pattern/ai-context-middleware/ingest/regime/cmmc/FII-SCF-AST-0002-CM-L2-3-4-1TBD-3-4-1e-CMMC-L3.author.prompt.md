You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: CM.L2-3.4.1 (FII: FII-SCF-AST-0002). 

The policy must follow this structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Each section should be clearly defined using H2 headings (##). 

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance in asset management.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to performing accurate inventories of technology assets.
3. **Scope**: Define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Specify task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in asset management.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings per requirement:
     - "1. REQUIREMENT:"
     - "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:"
     - "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:"
   - Describe how machine evidence would be collected and verified, emphasizing automation and practicality.
   - Provide specific, verifiable actions for human attestation when automation is impractical.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for documenting them.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (**Annual Review**).
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (**SMART**) instructions, and emphasizes the importance of attestation methods throughout. The policy must not include References subsections within individual sections, and the document must end with exactly ONE References section.
