# Change Management Policy

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this Change Management Policy is to establish a structured approach to managing changes within the organization. Effective change management is crucial for minimizing disruptions, ensuring compliance, and maintaining the integrity of systems and data. This policy outlines the procedures and responsibilities necessary to facilitate controlled and documented changes across all relevant environments.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to implementing a comprehensive change management program that ensures all changes to systems, applications, and processes are conducted in a controlled manner. This commitment includes adherence to best practices, compliance with regulatory requirements, and the continuous improvement of change management processes.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all entities and environments within the organization, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- Internal IT infrastructure

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Change Manager + Daily**: Oversee the change management process and ensure compliance with this policy.
- **IT Staff + As Needed**: Implement approved changes and document all actions taken.
- **Quality Assurance Team + Weekly**: Review changes for compliance and effectiveness.
- **Compliance Officer + Monthly**: Audit change management processes and report findings.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: All changes must be documented, assessed for risk, approved by relevant stakeholders, and communicated to affected parties.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize automated tools to track change requests, approvals, and implementation logs. Ensure that all changes are logged in a centralized change management system that supports API integration with Surveilr.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Require personnel to submit change request forms, maintain change logs, and provide evidence of stakeholder approvals. These documents should be ingested into Surveilr for verification.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following **SMART** criteria:
- **Specific**: All changes must have documented approvals.
- **Measurable**: 100% of changes must be logged in the change management system.
- **Achievable**: Changes must be reviewed by the Quality Assurance Team within one week of implementation.
- **Relevant**: Changes must align with organizational goals and compliance requirements.
- **Time-bound**: All change requests must be processed within 48 hours.

## 7. Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Change Manager. A formal request for an exception should include justification and be submitted to the Compliance Officer for review. All exceptions must be recorded in Surveilr for tracking and auditing purposes.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All change management records must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy must be reviewed and updated at least **once a year** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through formal attestation. Critical actions taken during the change management process must be logged for audit purposes. Any exceptions to this policy must also be formally documented and reviewed.
