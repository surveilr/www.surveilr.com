# Event Log Report Generation Policy

## Introduction
Event log report generation is a critical component in the detection and assessment of anomalous activities within an organization's IT infrastructure. By systematically capturing and analyzing event logs from various systems, organizations can gain insights into potential security incidents, compliance violations, and operational inefficiencies. These reports serve as a foundational element for incident response, risk management, and continuous monitoring, ultimately enhancing the overall security posture.

## Policy Statement
The organization mandates the generation of event log reports for all relevant systems and applications. These reports must be generated automatically and made available for review to ensure timely detection and assessment of anomalous activities.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit data

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer:** Ensure the execution of event log report generation procedures **Monthly** and review generated reports for compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **IT Security Team:** Monitor the event log generation process and validate the integrity of logs **Daily**. Escalate any anomalies or concerns to the Compliance Officer.
- **System Administrators:** Configure and maintain logging mechanisms within systems and applications **Weekly** to ensure that event logs are generated correctly and stored securely.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   The organization is required to implement a robust event log report generation capability that facilitates continuous monitoring of systems for anomalous behavior.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   Machine attestation methods will involve automating the generation and storage of event log reports using Surveilr. This includes leveraging Surveilrâ€™s capabilities to ensure logs are timestamped, immutable, and retrievable for review.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   A designated individual within the IT Security Team will review and sign off on the generated event log reports. This action will be documented within Surveilr, ensuring a clear audit trail of human oversight.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated using the following measurable criteria:
- At least 95% of event log reports generated must be reviewed within 48 hours of generation.
- Anomalies detected in event logs must be reported and addressed within 72 hours.
- A minimum of 90% adherence to scheduled report generation by assigned roles.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Documentation should include:
- The rationale for the exception
- The duration of the exception
- Any compensating controls implemented during the exception period

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** Event logs and reports must be retained for a minimum of 365 days to comply with auditing and compliance requirements.
- **Annual Review:** This policy will undergo an annual review to ensure its relevance and efficacy in meeting compliance requirements and addressing emerging threats.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions taken regarding event log report generation. Any exceptions to the policy must be formally documented and reviewed.
