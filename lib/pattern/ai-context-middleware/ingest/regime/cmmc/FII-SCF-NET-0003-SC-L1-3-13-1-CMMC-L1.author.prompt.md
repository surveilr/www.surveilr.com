You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: SC.L1-3.13.1 (FII: FII-SCF-NET-0003). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy **MUST** contain the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Ensure that **References subsections do NOT appear within any policy sections**; they should only be found at the very end of the document.

2. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting, including H2 headings (##) for major sections, paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. 

3. **Attestation Guidance**: Each section should:
   - Explain the control requirement clearly.
   - Suggest **machine attestation methods** for evidence collection (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
   - Suggest **human attestation methods** when automation isn't possible (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report").
   - Prioritize **machine attestability** in your suggestions, ensuring that every policy section includes attestation guidance.

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** and a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

5. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Define the policy's scope explicitly to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit data.

6. **Responsibilities Section**: Define **specific, task-level duties** for each role mentioned, using **Action Verb + Frequency** language. Link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery action.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require **workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, and mandate **comprehensive audit logging** for all critical actions.

9. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use the mandatory structure for evidence collection methods:
   - Numbered subheadings for each requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

10. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

11. **Keyword Emphasis**: Ensure the policy text explicitly uses and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

12. **End the document** with exactly ONE **References section**. If external references exist, list them under "### References" using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, simply output "### References" followed by "None".

Remember to avoid including control identifiers, control questions, and FII identifiers in the policy content. Focus solely on creating a robust policy document that maximizes machine attestability through Surveilr.
