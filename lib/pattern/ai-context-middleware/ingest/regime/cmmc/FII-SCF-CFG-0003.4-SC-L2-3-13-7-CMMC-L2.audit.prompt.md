You're an **official auditor (e.g., cybersecurity auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "Prevent split tunneling for remote devices unless the split tunnel is securely provisioned using organization-defined safeguards."
Control Code: SC.L2-3.13.7,
Control Question: Does the organization prevent split tunneling for remote devices unless the split tunnel is securely provisioned using organization-defined safeguards?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-CFG-0003.4
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish clear guidelines for preventing split tunneling for remote devices within the organization. Split tunneling, which allows simultaneous access to both local and remote networks, poses significant security risks by exposing sensitive data to potential interception. Preventing unsanctioned split tunneling is crucial for maintaining compliance with security standards and protecting sensitive information across all organizational environments. The organization is committed to preventing split tunneling for remote devices unless securely provisioned with organization-defined safeguards."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "The organization employs automated tools to monitor network configurations and routing tables, ensuring that any split tunneling is identified and logged in real-time. Additionally, management conducts regular reviews and documents secure tunnel provisioning processes, maintaining records for compliance verification."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - SC.L2-3.13.7

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** SC.L2-3.13.7
**Control Question:** Does the organization prevent split tunneling for remote devices unless the split tunnel is securely provisioned using organization-defined safeguards?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-CFG-0003.4
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** Prevent split tunneling for remote devices unless the split tunnel is securely provisioned using organization-defined safeguards.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization mandates the prevention of split tunneling for remote devices.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated tools monitoring network configurations.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion via network monitoring tools.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM network_configurations WHERE split_tunnel = 'enabled';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence demonstrates that the organization has implemented automated monitoring tools as required by the control.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Regular reviews of tunnel configurations must be conducted.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Documentation of regular reviews by management.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Human attestation recorded in the system.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** Evidence of documented reviews supports compliance with the control's requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Management must document secure tunnel provisioning processes.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Records of secure tunnel provisioning processes maintained by management.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Management reviews and approves configurations.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Records stored in Surveilr as evidence of compliance.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The documentation of secure tunnel provisioning processes demonstrates adherence to control requirements.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence aligns with the control's intent to prevent split tunneling unless securely provisioned.
* **Justification:** The automated monitoring and documentation processes demonstrate a commitment to maintaining security standards and protecting sensitive information.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The organization has implemented both machine and human attestation methods to effectively prevent unauthorized split tunneling, meeting the control's requirements.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [For each missing piece of evidence identified in Section 2, state *exactly* what is needed.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
