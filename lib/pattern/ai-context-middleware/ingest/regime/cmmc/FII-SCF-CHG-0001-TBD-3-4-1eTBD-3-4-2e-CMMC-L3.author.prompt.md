You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: FII-SCF-CHG-0001). 

The policy document must follow the exact structure outlined below, ensuring that each section is comprehensive, clear, and maximizes machine attestability through Surveilr. Each section must include specific instructions for evidence collection and verification, with a focus on achieving a 100% compliance score.

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance in the context of Change Management.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to implementing a change management program.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify task-level duties for each role involved in the change management process, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Describe the specific change management requirements.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Outline the precise actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** KPIs/SLAs defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Detail any exceptions to the policy, including the process for approval and documentation.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: This section must be the final section of the policy document and should include any external references in the format [Link Text](URL). Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

Remember to use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code. Emphasize the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** by making them bold. 

Do not include any SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code in the policy. The policy must be structured without References subsections in each section, and end with exactly ONE References section.
