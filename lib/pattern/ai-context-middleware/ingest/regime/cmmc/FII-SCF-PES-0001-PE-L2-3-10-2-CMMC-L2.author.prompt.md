You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PE.L2-3.10.2 (FII: FII-SCF-PES-0001). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** 

Each section must adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: Use H2 headings (##) for each major requirement. 
   - Explain the control requirement clearly.
   - Suggest **MACHINE ATTESTATION** methods, focusing on practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
   - Suggest **HUMAN ATTESTATION** methods only when necessary, detailing specific actions and artifacts.

2. **Markdown Elements**: Utilize standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Hyperlinks should be formatted as [Link Text](URL).

3. **Attestation Guidance**: 
   - For **Machine Attestation**: Provide examples of how to collect evidence automatically.
   - For **Human Attestation**: Describe precise steps, required artifacts, and how to document these in Surveilr.

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for containment, correction, or violation sanction, along with a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

5. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

6. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Ensure each requirement includes examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

7. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Clearly define actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.

8. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role in the Responsibilities section and explicitly link to related organizational plans.

9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.

11. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings for each requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

12. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

13. **Markdown Formatting**: Ensure proper use of headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

14. **Hyperlinks**: Format external references as [Link Text](URL).

15. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the end.

16. **Prohibited Content**: Do not include SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

17. **Final Section Requirements**: The References section is the FINAL section of the policy document, and it must not contain control identifiers or additional content.

18. **Keyword Emphasis**: Explicitly bold the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

Remember, do not include References subsections within individual policy sections; they should only appear at the end of the document in the designated References section.
