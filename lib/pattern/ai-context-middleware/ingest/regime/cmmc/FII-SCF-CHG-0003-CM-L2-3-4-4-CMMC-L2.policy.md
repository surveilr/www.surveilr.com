## Introduction

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all proposed changes to systems and processes are analyzed for potential security impacts prior to implementation. This is critical for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of sensitive information, particularly electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). The policy aligns with the CMMC control CM.L2-3.4.4, which mandates a structured approach to change management.

## Policy Statement

All proposed changes to systems, applications, and processes must undergo a formal security impact analysis to identify and mitigate potential risks. This analysis will be documented and reviewed to ensure compliance with organizational security standards and regulatory requirements.

## Scope

This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including:

- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## Responsibilities

- **Change Management Team**: Responsible for conducting security impact analyses on proposed changes and documenting findings.
- **IT Security Team**: Reviews change proposals for compliance with security standards and provides recommendations.
- **Department Managers**: Ensure that team members submit change proposals and that they are reviewed in a timely manner.
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversees adherence to this policy and coordinates with the Change Management Team for audits and reviews.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**: Conduct a security impact analysis for all proposed changes.
   
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automated tools will log all change proposals and their corresponding security analyses in a centralized repository. Alerts will be generated for changes that lack a completed analysis.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Change proposals must include a signed document from the Change Management Team indicating that a security impact analysis was performed. This document will be uploaded to Surveilr for compliance tracking.

## Verification Criteria

Compliance will be validated through the following measurable criteria:

- 100% of proposed changes must have a documented security impact analysis.
- All analyses must be completed within **5 business days** of proposal submission.
- A minimum of **95%** of change proposals must be reviewed and approved by the IT Security Team.

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Any exceptions will be reviewed during the **Annual Review** process to determine if they should be continued or revoked.

## Lifecycle Requirements

- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to change proposals and security analyses must be retained for a minimum of **3 years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will be reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through a formal attestation process. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for all critical actions related to change management, including approvals and exceptions.
