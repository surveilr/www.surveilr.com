# Privileged Access Management Policy

## Introduction
In todayâ€™s digital landscape, safeguarding sensitive information is paramount, particularly when it involves protected health information (PHI). Restricting and controlling privileged access rights for users and services is essential to minimize the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential misuse of information. Effective management of privileged access not only protects the integrity and confidentiality of electronic protected health information (ePHI) but also ensures compliance with regulatory standards such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC). 

## Policy Statement
[Organization Name] is committed to managing privileged access rights effectively to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive systems and information. This policy sets forth the principles and requirements for controlling privileged access to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and ensure the security and confidentiality of ePHI.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to privileged accounts and systems that create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. It encompasses all relevant entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- On-premises systems
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)
- All channels used to manage and interact with ePHI

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Conduct quarterly policy approval and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - Review access logs daily to identify unauthorized access attempts.
  - Implement and manage access controls on systems.
  - Conduct monthly access reviews to ensure compliance with access policies.
- **Department Managers**: 
  - Review and approve access requests semi-annually.
  - Document and report any access anomalies to the IT Security Team.
- **Human Resources**: 
  - Facilitate user onboarding and offboarding processes to ensure timely access management.
- **All Workforce Members**: 
  - Acknowledge and attest to understanding and compliance with this policy annually.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: 
   The control requires that the organization restricts and manages privileged access rights, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive systems and data.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**:
   - Utilize OSquery to periodically gather data on user access and system configurations to verify compliance with access controls.
   - Implement API integrations with identity management systems to automate the validation of access rights and permissions.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**:
   - Managers must perform access reviews every six months, signing off on access privileges and documenting their approvals in a centralized access management system.
   - Maintain records of access review meetings and decisions, which should be ingested into the compliance documentation repository.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be assessed based on the following criteria:
- 100% of privileged access requests must be documented and approved before access is granted.
- Access reviews must show that 90% of privileged accounts are reviewed and validated within the defined period.
- Anomalies in access logs must be addressed and documented within 48 hours.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted under specific conditions such as urgent operational needs or unique business requirements. Requests for exceptions must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer and must include:
- A detailed justification for the exception.
- The duration of the exception.
- A plan to mitigate risks associated with the exception.

## Lifecycle Requirements
All evidence and logs related to privileged access management must be retained for a minimum period of six years. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure its effectiveness and applicability to current operations.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through attestation forms. Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for all critical actions related to privileged access management. Any granted exceptions will be formally documented and made available for audit purposes.
