# CMMC Policy Document for Control AC.L2-3.1.15

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements for restricting the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access, ensuring compliance with CMMC control AC.L2-3.1.15. The purpose of this policy is to safeguard sensitive information and systems against unauthorized access and to ensure operational integrity.

## Policy Statement
The organization will restrict the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information through remote access strictly to compelling operational needs. Access will be granted only to authorized personnel, based on defined criteria, and monitored for compliance.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- **Cloud-hosted systems**
- **SaaS applications**
- **Third-party vendor systems**
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit security-relevant information.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - Define and maintain access control policies.
  - Monitor remote access logs and compliance.
  - Conduct quarterly access reviews.
  
- **System Administrators**: 
  - Implement access control measures as defined in organizational plans.
  - Ensure systems are configured to log remote access attempts.
  
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - Oversee adherence to this policy and relevant regulations.
  - Facilitate annual reviews of policy effectiveness.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**: Restrict remote access to privileged commands.
   
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**:
   - Automated logging of remote access attempts.
   - Use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for access.
   - Regular automated audits of user access rights.
   
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**:
   - Personnel must submit an access request form detailing operational needs.
   - Managers must review and approve access requests.
   - Documentation of approvals must be uploaded to Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- **Compliance will be validated against the following KPIs/SLAs**:
  - 100% of remote access requests must be logged and authorized within **24 hours**.
  - Access logs must demonstrate at least **95% compliance** with defined access control measures during quarterly audits.
  - Annual policy review must be completed and documented within **30 days** after each review.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. All exceptions will be reviewed annually to assess ongoing necessity and risk.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All access logs must be retained for a minimum of **12 months**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure relevance and effectiveness, with updates made as necessary.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for all critical actions, including access requests, approvals, and system changes.
