You're an **official auditor (e.g.,  auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

- **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
- **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
  - **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
  - **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
  - **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
- **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
  - **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
  - **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
  - **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
- **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

- **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
- **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization synchronizes internal system clocks with an authoritative time source to maintain the integrity of time-sensitive data across all systems."
  - Control Code: AU.L2-3.3.7
  - Control Question: Does the organization synchronize internal system clocks with an authoritative time source?
  - Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-MON-0007.1
- **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
  "The purpose of this Time Synchronization Policy is to ensure that all internal system clocks across the organization are accurately synchronized with an authoritative time source. Proper time synchronization is critical in maintaining the integrity of time-sensitive data, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and protecting the organization's information security posture."
- **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Logs from time synchronization services indicate successful synchronization with NTP servers, and configurations verified via OSquery show all systems are set up to synchronize with the authoritative time source. Certification of compliance from personnel after biannual reviews is also included."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AU.L2-3.3.7

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** AU.L2-3.3.7
**Control Question:** Does the organization synchronize internal system clocks with an authoritative time source?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-MON-0007.1
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization synchronizes internal system clocks with an authoritative time source to maintain the integrity of time-sensitive data across all systems.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** All systems must synchronize their clocks with an authoritative time source, such as NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Logs from time synchronization services indicate successful synchronization with NTP servers.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion from NTP logs.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM RSSD.time_sync_logs WHERE sync_status = 'successful';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided NTP synchronization logs clearly demonstrate that all systems are successfully synchronizing with the authoritative time source, thus meeting the control requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Configuration settings must verify that systems are configured to synchronize with the authorized time source.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Configurations verified via OSquery show all systems set up to synchronize with the authoritative time source.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Configuration checks via OSquery.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM RSSD.system_config WHERE time_sync_source = 'NTP';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The OSquery results confirm that the necessary configurations are in place, verifying compliance with the control's requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Personnel must conduct periodic reviews of time synchronization settings and provide certification of compliance.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Certification of compliance from personnel after biannual reviews is included.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Periodic reviews conducted biannually.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Documentation of signed attestation forms.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The certification provided serves as valid human attestation that periodic reviews have been conducted and confirms compliance with the control.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent and Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The synchronization of internal clocks with an authoritative time source ensures the integrity of time-sensitive data, which aligns with the control's intent.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** No critical gaps identified; all evidence aligns with both the letter and spirit of the control.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit findings indicate full compliance with the control requirements. All aspects of evidence reviewed, both machine and human, demonstrate that the organization effectively synchronizes internal system clocks with an authoritative time source.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [For each missing piece of evidence identified in Section 2, state *exactly* what is needed.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [For each instance of non-compliant evidence identified in Section 2, clearly state *why* it is non-compliant and what *specific correction* is required.]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [List precise steps a human auditor or compliance officer needs to take.]
    * [Specify which teams or individuals are responsible for producing or correcting the evidence.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [Outline the process for re-submission of the corrected/missing evidence for re-evaluation.]
