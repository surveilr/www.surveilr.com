You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.11 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0025). 

The policy document must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Each section must adhere to the guidelines provided below:

1. **Document Structure**: Each major requirement must use H2 headings (##) and include:
   - An explanation of the control requirement.
   - Suggested **machine attestation** methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect session activity logs daily").
   - Suggested **human attestation** methods where unavoidable (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly review of user logout procedures").
   - IMPORTANT: Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections.

2. **Markdown Elements**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Use the format [Link Text](URL) for citation links.

3. **Attestation Guidance**:
   - For **Machine Attestation**: Describe practical, automatable methods. Examples: "Automatically log user session end times and ingest this data into Surveilr for compliance verification."
   - For **Human Attestation**: Describe precise actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr. Examples: "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly review report of user logout compliance."

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)** for processes like logout enforcement.

5. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems, particularly focusing on user sessions and inactivity logout.

6. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

7. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.

8. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section must define specific task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned, and explicitly link to related organizational plans.

9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

11. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

12. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

13. **Verification Criteria**: Include clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

14. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting with headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

15. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

16. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end. 

17. **Final Section Requirements**: The References section is the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else. 

18. **References Section Format**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

19. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text MUST explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

Ensure that the policy is structured according to these instructions and does not include References subsections within individual policy sections. The document must conclude with exactly ONE References section.
