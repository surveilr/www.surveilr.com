You're an **official auditor (e.g.,  auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

* **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
* **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
    * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
    * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
    * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
* **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
    * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
    * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
    * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
* **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

* **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
* **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure the security of physical spaces where sensitive information is stored, processed, or transmitted by monitoring physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment."
  * Control Code: PE.L2-3.10.2
  * Control Question: Does the organization monitor physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment?
  * Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-PES-0005.1
* **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
  "The organization is committed to the continuous monitoring of physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment to detect unauthorized access attempts and ensure the safety and security of sensitive information. This involves daily monitoring of surveillance logs, immediate reporting of anomalies, and quarterly reviews of compliance."
* **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Surveillance logs for the past month, API integration data showing alarm monitoring events, signed monthly reports from the security manager documenting incidents, and quarterly compliance audit reports from the compliance officer."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report  (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - PE.L2-3.10.2

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., HIPAA Auditor]
**Control Code:** PE.L2-3.10.2
**Control Question:** Does the organization monitor physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-PES-0005.1
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To ensure the security of physical spaces where sensitive information is stored, processed, or transmitted by monitoring physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** 100% of surveillance logs are monitored daily.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Surveillance logs for the past month were provided.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** API integration to collect and validate alarm monitoring data from surveillance systems.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM surveillance_logs WHERE log_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH;
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence shows that surveillance logs were monitored daily, fulfilling the requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** At least 95% of alarm events are reviewed within 24 hours of occurrence.
    * **Provided Evidence:** API integration data showing alarm monitoring events and response times.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion from alarm monitoring systems.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM alarm_events WHERE response_time < 24;
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The data indicates that at least 95% of alarm events were reviewed within the specified timeframe.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Monthly alarm monitoring reports signed by the security manager.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed monthly reports from the security manager documenting incidents.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** The security manager reviews and signs the reports.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Documented storage of signed reports.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided evidence includes signed reports that fulfill the requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Quarterly compliance audits documented by the compliance officer.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Quarterly compliance audit reports from the compliance officer.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** The compliance officer conducts audits and documents findings.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Collection of audit reports.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The quarterly audit reports provide sufficient evidence of compliance with the requirement.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent  Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the organization effectively meets the control's underlying purpose and intent through diligent monitoring and reporting.
* **Justification:** The evidence supports the organization's commitment to maintaining the security of sensitive information by continuously monitoring intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None noted.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and  Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The organization has provided comprehensive evidence demonstrating compliance with the control's requirements and intent, fulfilling both machine and human attestation aspects effectively.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
