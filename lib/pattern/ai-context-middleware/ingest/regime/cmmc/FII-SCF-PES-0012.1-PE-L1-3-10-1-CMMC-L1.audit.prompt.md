You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization protects power and telecommunications cabling carrying data or supporting information services from interception, interference or damage."
Control Code: PE.L1-3.10.1,
Control Question: Does the organization protect power and telecommunications cabling carrying data or supporting information services from interception, interference or damage?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-PES-0012.1
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for protecting power and telecommunications cabling that carries data or supports information services. This policy ensures compliance with the CMMC control PE.L1-3.10.1, which mandates organizations to protect their cabling infrastructure from interception, interference, or damage. The organization shall implement measures to safeguard power and telecommunications cabling. This includes physical protection against unauthorized access, environmental hazards, and other potential threats to the integrity of these systems."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "OSquery results show configurations of power and telecommunications cabling collected for Q1 2025. Facilities Manager signed inspection checklist for Q1 2025 submitted to Surveilr. Environmental monitoring logs indicating temperature and humidity levels maintained around cabling infrastructure for the same period."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - PE.L1-3.10.1

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** CMMC Auditor
**Control Code:** PE.L1-3.10.1
**Control Question:** Does the organization protect power and telecommunications cabling carrying data or supporting information services from interception, interference or damage?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-PES-0012.1
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization protects power and telecommunications cabling carrying data or supporting information services from interception, interference or damage.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must protect power and telecommunications cabling from interception, interference, or damage.
    * **Provided Evidence:** OSquery results show configurations of power and telecommunications cabling collected for Q1 2025.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery for endpoint data.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM cabling_config WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-01' AND timestamp <= '2025-03-31';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The OSquery results confirm that the cabling configurations are intact and collected per the policy requirements.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Environmental monitoring of cabling integrity.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Environmental monitoring logs indicating temperature and humidity levels maintained around cabling infrastructure for Q1 2025.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated logging of environmental conditions.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM environmental_logs WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-01' AND timestamp <= '2025-03-31';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The environmental logs demonstrate active monitoring, which aligns with the control's intent.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Physical inspection certification by the Facilities Manager.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Facilities Manager signed inspection checklist for Q1 2025 submitted to Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Quarterly inspections of cabling integrity.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The signed checklist is stored in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed inspection checklist confirms that the Facilities Manager conducted the required inspections and documented the findings, satisfying the control's requirements.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent/Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided demonstrates a comprehensive approach to safeguarding cabling infrastructure.
* **Justification:** The integration of machine attestation via OSquery and environmental monitoring, alongside human attestation, fulfills the control's intent and ensures compliance with its underlying purpose.
