You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: MA.L2-3.7.4 (FII: FII-SCF-MNT-0004.2). 

The policy must follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** 

1. **Introduction**: Explain the purpose of the policy regarding checking media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before use.
  
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to ensuring that all media are checked for malicious code prior to usage.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope to include **all relevant entities and environments**, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and **all channels** used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define **specific, task-level duties (Action Verb + Frequency)** for each role involved in the compliance process. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings per requirement: 
     - "1. REQUIREMENT:" - Explain the control requirement.
     - "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:" - Suggest machine attestation methods, ensuring automation is prioritized, and include practical, automatable methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to verify the integrity of media prior to usage").
     - "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:" - Describe precise steps and artifacts required for human attestation (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the media validation report, which is uploaded to Surveilr with metadata (review date, reviewer name)").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** KPIs/SLAs defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Detail any exceptions to the policy requirements and the process for their approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum **data retention** periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (**Annual Review**).

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

**IMPORTANT**: Every policy section must include attestation guidance. Failure to include attestation methods for a requirement results in an automatic non-compliance. 

The policy must not include References subsections within policy sections, and it must end with exactly ONE References section.
