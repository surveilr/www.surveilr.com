You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PS.L2-3.9.2 (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0008). 

### Policy Structure
1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and its importance in managing logical and physical access authorizations.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organizationâ€™s commitment to adjusting access authorizations upon personnel reassignment or transfer.
3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy to include all personnel, systems, and facilities relevant to access management.
4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in access management.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the requirement for timely adjustments to access authorizations.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest methods for automated evidence collection (e.g., using Surveilr to track access changes).
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Outline precise steps and artifacts required for human attestation (e.g., a signed acknowledgment of access changes).
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear and measurable criteria for compliance validation, linked to **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Describe any exceptions to the policy, including the process for documenting those exceptions.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and specify the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Mandate workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, and detail comprehensive audit logging requirements.
10. **References**: List all external references used in the policy document.

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections. The policy document must conclude with exactly ONE single References section. Emphasize the need for **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the document by using **BOLD** formatting for these keywords.
