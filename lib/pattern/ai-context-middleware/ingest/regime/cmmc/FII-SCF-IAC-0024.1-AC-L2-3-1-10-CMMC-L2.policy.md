# Policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.10

## Introduction
Pattern-hiding displays are essential security mechanisms that obscure sensitive information on screens during session locks, preventing unauthorized access to data. This control is vital in safeguarding organizational assets and ensuring compliance with security standards. By implementing pattern-hiding displays, we mitigate risks associated with data exposure when devices are unattended.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to implementing and maintaining pattern-hiding displays on all applicable systems to conceal information during session locks. This policy aims to enhance the security of sensitive information and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access organizational systems, including:
- Cloud-hosted environments
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security**: Daily review of display settings to ensure compliance with pattern-hiding requirements.
- **System Administrators**: Weekly verification of configuration settings to confirm pattern-hiding displays are enabled.
- **Compliance Officer**: Quarterly auditing of policy adherence and documentation of findings.
- **All Employees**: Immediate reporting of any display-related vulnerabilities or issues.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization mandates the use of pattern-hiding displays to ensure sensitive information is not visible when a session is locked.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize Surveilr to verify configuration settings of display systems and ensure that pattern-hiding functionality is active and properly configured.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The IT manager must sign a quarterly review report confirming compliance with the display requirements, documenting any anomalies or corrective actions taken.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through:
- Successful configuration verifications logged by Surveilr with a target of 100% adherence to display settings.
- Quarterly reports signed by the IT manager, with a target of zero non-compliance incidents documented.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. The request for an exception must include a justification and the proposed duration of the exception.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs related to display settings must be retained for a minimum of three years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will be reviewed annually to ensure its ongoing effectiveness and relevance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for critical actions related to display settings and compliance checks.
