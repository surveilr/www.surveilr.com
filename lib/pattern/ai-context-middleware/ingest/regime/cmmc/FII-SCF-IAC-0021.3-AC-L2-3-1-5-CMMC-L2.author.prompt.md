You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "AC.L2-3.1.5" (FII: "FII-SCF-IAC-0021.3"). 

## Policy Document Structure
1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the need for restricting the assignment of privileged accounts.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on privileged account assignments.
3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties for roles involved in managing privileged accounts, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. **REQUIREMENT**: Restrict the assignment of privileged accounts to management-approved personnel and/or roles.
   - 2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe how to collect evidence automatically using methods like API integrations with identity management systems to confirm approved personnel.
   - 3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify actions such as a manager signing a quarterly report of privileged account assignments, including how this documentation is uploaded to Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, linked to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the previous section.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for documenting them.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
10. **References**: End the document with a single References section formatted as follows.

### Important Instructions
- Use H2 headings (##) for each section.
- Include bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
- Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections; the References section should appear only at the end of the document.
- Ensure all sections are written with a focus on maximizing machine attestability and include specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) instructions.
- Emphasize the importance of documenting both machine and human attestation methods.
