You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "IA.L1-3.5.1, IA.L1-3.5.2" (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0002). 

The policy document must follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy and its importance in ensuring compliance with CMMC requirements.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to uniquely identifying and centrally authenticating, authorizing, and auditing organizational users and processes.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify task-level duties for each role involved, using **Action Verbs + Frequency** (e.g., "Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review"). Explicitly link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. **REQUIREMENT**: Describe the specific control requirements for user identification, authentication, authorization, and auditing.
   - 2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect user authentication logs daily").
   - 3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define precise steps and artifacts for human actions (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly user access review report").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** KPIs/SLAs defined in the previous section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the process for approval and documentation.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a single References section at the very end of the document, formatted as [Link Text](URL) for any external references. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

The policy must maximize machine attestability, with every section including attestation guidance. Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code for technical terms. Ensure that the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are explicitly used and **BOLD** in the text. 

Do not include SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code. The final document must end with exactly ONE References section.
