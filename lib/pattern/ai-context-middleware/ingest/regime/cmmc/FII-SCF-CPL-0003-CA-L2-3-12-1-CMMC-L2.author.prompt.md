You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: CA.L2-3.12.1 (FII: FII-SCF-CPL-0003). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure without including References subsections within individual policy sections; end the document with exactly ONE References section. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy and its purpose.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the policy's intent and commitment.
3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, explicitly mentioning all relevant entities and environments including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Specify granular roles and task-level duties for each role mentioned using **Action Verb + Frequency** language.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings for each requirement detailing machine and human attestation methods.
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Describe specific actions, artifacts, and how they are ingested into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., **Annual Review**).
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.
10. **References**: Include a single section at the end for external references using [Link Text](URL) format.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes SMART operational details, and explicitly defines all required elements without omitting any mandatory content. Remember to **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

The policy must not include SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code, and it should not contain control identifiers, metadata, or additional content after the References section.
