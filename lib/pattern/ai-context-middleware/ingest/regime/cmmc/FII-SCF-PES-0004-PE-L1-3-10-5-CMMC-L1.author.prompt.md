You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PE.L1-3.10.5 (FII: FII-SCF-PES-0004). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide a clear overview of the policy purpose and its significance in maintaining physical and environmental security.

2. **Policy Statement**: State the commitment to identifying systems, equipment, and respective operating environments that require limited physical access.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information (ePHI).

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role involved in implementing and monitoring the policy, such as the Compliance Officer and IT Security personnel. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: For each requirement, use the following structure:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest machine attestation methods. Describe practical, automatable methods to collect and validate compliance evidence, prioritizing machine attestability.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Describe specific, verifiable actions a human must perform, including the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for handling exceptions, including documentation and approval requirements.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., "retain for 6 years") and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., "reviewed at least annually").

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure the document does not include References subsections within individual policy sections, and instead ends with exactly ONE References section. Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code. The policy text MUST explicitly use and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. Failure to include these keywords in bold will result in non-compliance.
