# Physical Access Authorization Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish and enforce physical access authorizations to ensure the security of our facilities and protect sensitive information. This policy is crucial in preventing unauthorized access, safeguarding assets, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. By defining clear protocols for physical access, we enhance our organizational resilience and maintain the integrity of our operational environments.

## Policy Statement
It is the policy of the organization to enforce strict physical access authorizations for all physical access points to facilities. All individuals seeking access must be verified and authorized according to established procedures to minimize the risk of unauthorized entry and protect sensitive information.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and third parties accessing physical locations owned or operated by the organization. It encompasses all environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels utilized to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

## Responsibilities

- **IT Department**: Maintain access control systems **weekly** to ensure operational integrity and report any anomalies in access logs.
- **Human Resources**: Process access requests and maintain records for personnel authorizations **upon hiring and annually** for review.
- **Management**: Review and approve access authorization exceptions **monthly**, ensuring alignment with organizational security plans.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Physical access authorizations must be documented and validated before granting access to any restricted area.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Access control systems will be utilized to log all entry and exit events automatically, providing a digital trail for compliance.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Personnel must complete access request forms and provide identification, which will be stored in Surveilr for future audits.

Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following **SMART** objectives:
- 100% of access requests processed within **24 hours**.
- Monthly audits of access logs to ensure a **95%** compliance rate with authorization protocols.
- Annual review of access controls to identify and address any discrepancies.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented through an official exception request form, outlining the rationale and duration of the exception. Approval must be obtained from management, and exceptions should be reviewed **quarterly**.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Minimum **Data Retention** period for access logs is **two years**.
- This policy will undergo a mandatory **Annual Review** to ensure relevance and compliance with evolving security standards.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
