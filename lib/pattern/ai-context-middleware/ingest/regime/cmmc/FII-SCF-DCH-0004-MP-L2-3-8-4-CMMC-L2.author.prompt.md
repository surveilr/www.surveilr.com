You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: MP.L2-3.8.4 (FII: FII-SCF-DCH-0004). 

The policy document must follow this structure without including References subsections within each section, and it must end with exactly ONE References section. Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and addresses all requirements as outlined below:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.**

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For containment, correction, or **violation sanction**, include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps (e.g., isolate system, retrain user, segment network, initiate investigation, impose sanction) and a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)** (e.g., contain within 48 hours, remediate within 5 business days, conclude investigation within 15 days).

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed)**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section must define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review). Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Sanction Policy) for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: The policy must contain a dedicated subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update** (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: The policy must require **Workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, **Comprehensive audit logging** for all critical actions (creation, modification, termination), and formal documentation for all exceptions (justification, duration, approval).

9. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Structure this section with numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

10. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in Requirement 2.

11. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

12. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

13. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

14. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document.** After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content. 

15. **References Section Format**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

Ensure that the policy document is robust, clear, and fully compliant, achieving a 100% compliance score.
