# Endpoint Security Policy for Control SC.L2-3.13.16

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish comprehensive measures for protecting the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, **availability**, and **safety** of endpoint devices utilized within our organization. As endpoints serve as critical touchpoints for accessing sensitive data, including ePHI (electronic Protected Health Information), it is paramount that these devices are safeguarded against unauthorized access, potential breaches, and other security risks. This policy outlines our commitment to maintaining a secure environment that aligns with regulatory requirements and best practices.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is dedicated to ensuring robust **endpoint security** as part of our overall information security strategy. This policy articulates our commitment to protecting endpoint devices from threats, ensuring the safe transmission and storage of sensitive data, and promoting a culture of security awareness among all employees. The overarching goals are to mitigate risks associated with endpoint vulnerabilities and to comply with relevant regulations, including the requirements set forth in CMMC control SC.L2-3.13.16.

## Scope
This policy applies to all **cloud-hosted systems**, **SaaS applications**, **third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and **all channels** utilized to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. It encompasses all organizational employees, contractors, and any third parties who have access to endpoint devices within the organization. This policy covers both on-premises and remote access scenarios to ensure comprehensive endpoint security.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - **Quarterly policy approval** to ensure alignment with current regulations and organizational needs.
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - **Daily log review** of endpoint security events to identify and respond to potential threats.
- **All Employees**: 
  - **Monthly security training** to foster awareness of endpoint security practices and potential threats.

The aforementioned roles must reference related organizational plans, such as the **Incident Response Plan**, **Disaster Recovery Plan**, and **Sanction Policy**, for proper escalation and recovery actions in the event of a security incident.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT:
The organization will maintain and regularly review logs and records related to endpoint security compliance.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
- Automated logging mechanisms must be implemented to capture security events in real-time.
- Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for continuous monitoring and machine attestability.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
- Employees must complete a **monthly training module** on endpoint security, with records of completion logged in Surveilr.
- Collect signed acknowledgment forms indicating understanding and compliance with this policy.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following measurable criteria:
- **100% completion rate** of monthly security training by all employees.
- **Daily review** of security logs with documented findings and actions taken.
- **Quarterly assessments** of endpoint device security posture, measured against defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented clearly, including:
- Justification for the exception.
- Duration of the exception.
- Approval from the **Compliance Officer** and relevant stakeholders.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to endpoint security compliance must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- The policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness in addressing current security threats and compliance requirements.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members are required to acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through an attestation process. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to endpoint security. Documentation for all exceptions must be formalized and readily available for review.
