# Policy Document for Control: IA.L2-3.5.10

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements for protecting authenticators used to access sensitive information, ensuring that our organization complies with CMMC control IA.L2-3.5.10. Protecting authenticators is critical to safeguarding ePHI and maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information across all environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

## Policy Statement
The organization will implement measures to protect authenticators commensurate with the sensitivity of the information they provide access to. These measures will include both **MACHINE ATTESTATION** and **HUMAN ATTESTATION** methods to ensure comprehensive compliance and security.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access sensitive information.
- All systems and applications that create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI, including:
  - Cloud-hosted systems
  - SaaS applications
  - Third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)
  
## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**:

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Protect authenticators based on sensitivity.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
     - Implement automated tools to monitor and log authenticator usage and access attempts. Use SIEM solutions to generate alerts on suspicious activities.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
     - Document and submit user training completion certificates to Surveilr following each training session.

2. **REQUIREMENT**: Regularly review authenticator access logs.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
     - Automate the collection of authenticator access logs to be reviewed by the IT Security Team weekly.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
     - Conduct monthly reviews of access logs and submit findings to Surveilr.

3. **REQUIREMENT**: Update authenticator protections as necessary.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
     - Utilize version control systems to document changes in authenticator security measures.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
     - Provide change logs to Surveilr after every update.

## Verification Criteria
- Compliance will be verified through:
  - **Quarterly audits** showing 100% compliance in authenticator protection measures.
  - **Monthly reports** of unauthorized access attempts with less than 5% recurrence.
  - **Annual training completion rates** of 100% for all workforce members.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. All exceptions will be maintained in Surveilr for audit purposes.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to authenticator protection must be retained for **6 years**.
- **Policy Review**: This policy will be **reviewed at least annually** to ensure continued compliance with CMMC requirements.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge understanding and compliance with this policy through a digital attestation process. Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for all critical actions related to authenticator management. Formal documentation will be created for any exceptions granted.
