You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "CM.L2-3.4.9" (FII: FII-SCF-CFG-0005). 

The policy MUST include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Each section must adhere to the guidelines below:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy and its importance in restricting unauthorized software installations.
  
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on restricting non-privileged users from installing unauthorized software.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role mentioned (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review). Explicitly link related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan) for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Detail the specific requirement for restricting software installation.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection. For example, "Use OSquery to collect software installation logs daily."
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Describe precise steps and artifacts where human actions are needed. For example, "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly software installation review report."

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**. 

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the procedure for requesting and documenting exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least **Annually**').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

The policy should maximize machine attestability, with every section including attestation guidance. All statements must be **SMART** with a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and specific time-bound metrics (KPIs/SLAs) for processes such as containment, correction, or violation sanction. 

Ensure that the document uses standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code for technical terms. Do NOT include **References** subsections within policy sections; this section must only appear at the very end of the document. 

End the policy document with exactly ONE **References** section. If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None". 

Failure to follow these instructions or to include the specified sections will result in non-compliance.
