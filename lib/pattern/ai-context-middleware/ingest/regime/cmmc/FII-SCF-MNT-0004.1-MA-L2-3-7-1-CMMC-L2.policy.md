# CMMC Compliance Policy Document for Control: MA.L2-3.7.1 (FII: FII-SCF-MNT-0004.1)

## Introduction
This policy addresses the control requirement MA.L2-3.7.1, which mandates the inspection of maintenance tools brought into facilities by maintenance personnel. This control is crucial for ensuring the integrity and security of systems and environments, as unauthorized or improperly modified tools can pose significant risks. Compliance with this control is essential for safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining operational integrity.

## Policy Statement
The organization mandates that all maintenance tools carried into its facilities by maintenance personnel undergo thorough inspection to identify any improper or unauthorized modifications. This policy aims to prevent potential security vulnerabilities and ensure that all tools conform to established safety and performance standards.

## Scope
This policy applies to all maintenance personnel operating within the organization’s facilities, including:
- On-premises systems
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Systems managed by third-party vendors
All relevant environments and entities must adhere to this policy to maintain compliance with CMMC requirements.

## Responsibilities
- **Maintenance Personnel: Inspect tools + Prior to entry into the facility.**
- **Facility Security Officers: Conduct inspections + At every entry of maintenance personnel.**
- **Compliance Officers: Review inspection logs + Monthly.**
- **IT Department: Update and maintain inspection protocols + Annually.**
These roles are aligned with the organization’s escalation and recovery plans, ensuring clear pathways for reporting and addressing non-compliance or disciplinary actions.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   Maintenance personnel must provide a detailed log of all tools and their intended use. This log should be submitted for review prior to entering the facility.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   Automated systems will be employed to log tool inspections using RFID tagging. Each tool will be scanned upon entry, with records stored in Surveilr for machine attestability. The system will generate alerts for any discrepancies or unauthorized modifications.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   Maintenance personnel must complete a checklist during the inspection process, documenting the condition and modifications of each tool. This checklist will be submitted to the Facility Security Officer and retained in Surveilr for verification purposes.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 100% of maintenance tools must be inspected prior to entry.
- Inspection logs must be completed and submitted within 24 hours of tool entry.
- Non-compliance incidents will be tracked, with a goal of zero incidents over a rolling 12-month period.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. The documentation process includes specifying the reason for the exception, the duration, and any compensating controls that will be implemented during the exception period.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** Inspection logs and evidence must be retained for a period of **three years**.
- **Annual Review:** This policy will be reviewed and updated annually to ensure continued relevance and compliance with CMMC requirements.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging must be maintained for all critical actions associated with tool inspections. Any exceptions recorded must be formally documented and reviewed as part of the annual compliance audit process.
