## Introduction
This policy establishes the framework for ensuring that cybersecurity and data privacy requirements are systematically included in all contracts with subcontractors and suppliers. It is essential for safeguarding sensitive information, especially electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), and maintaining compliance with relevant regulations. By enforcing these requirements, the organization enhances its cybersecurity posture and promotes trust with stakeholders.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to incorporating robust cybersecurity and data privacy requirements in all relevant contracts with subcontractors and suppliers. This initiative aims to ensure that all parties involved in handling ePHI adhere to stringent security measures, thereby mitigating risks and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and standards.

## Scope
This policy applies to all relevant entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and approve contracts for compliance with cybersecurity and data privacy requirements **(Quarterly)**.
- **Contract Manager**: Ensure that all contracts include the necessary cybersecurity clauses **(Before contract finalization)**.

- After contract execution, provide signed acknowledgment of compliance from relevant parties, stored securely in Surveilr.
- Conduct periodic reviews of contracts, with documented findings submitted to the Compliance Officer.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following measurable criteria:
- Percentage of contracts reviewed that include required cybersecurity clauses.
- Timeliness of contract reviews as measured against **KPIs/SLAs** established in the Evidence Collection Methods.
- Documentation accuracy and completeness as per human attestation processes.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted under specific circumstances. The process for approval includes:
- Submitting a formal exception request to the Compliance Officer.
