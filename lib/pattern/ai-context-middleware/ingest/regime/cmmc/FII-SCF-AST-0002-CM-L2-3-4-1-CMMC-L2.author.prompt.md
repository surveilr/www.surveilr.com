You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "CM.L2-3.4.1" (FII: FII-SCF-AST-0002). 

The policy document must be structured as follows:

## Introduction
- Provide a clear overview of the purpose and importance of technology asset inventories.

## Policy Statement
- State the organization's commitment to maintaining accurate inventories of technology assets.

## Scope
- Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties for each role involved in asset management, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT:
   - Explain the control requirement for maintaining accurate inventories of technology assets.
   
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using OSquery to collect asset inventories daily and API integrations for validating authorized software products.

3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - Describe specific actions a human must perform, such as a manager signing off on quarterly inventory validation reports and documenting them in Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

## Exceptions
- Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification and approval.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

### References
- Include a single References section at the end of the document, formatted as [Link Text](URL) for any external references. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance for every requirement. The document must be compliant with all specified instructions, including the use of **SMART** objectives and the emphasis on **KPIs/SLAs**.
