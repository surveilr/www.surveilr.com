You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

- **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
- **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
  - **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
  - **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
  - **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
- **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
  - **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
  - **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
  - **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
- **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

- **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
- **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization utilizes antimalware technologies to detect and eradicate malicious code."
  - **Control Code:** SI.L1-3.14.2
  - **Control Question:** Does the organization utilize antimalware technologies to detect and eradicate malicious code?
  - **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-END-0004
- **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
  "This policy establishes the requirements for utilizing antimalware technologies to detect and eradicate malicious code within the organization, in compliance with CMMC control SI.L1-3.14.2. The purpose of this document is to outline the procedures and responsibilities necessary to ensure effective endpoint security across all environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems that handle sensitive data."
- **Provided Evidence for Audit:** 
  "1. OSquery results showing that 95% of endpoints have current antimalware signatures updated within the past 24 hours. 
   2. Automated logs from antimalware solutions capturing detection and remediation activities for the last month.
   3. IT Manager's signed monthly antimalware validation report for the previous month, uploaded to Surveilr.
   4. Attendance logs from quarterly training sessions on recognizing and reporting malware threats, submitted to Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report  (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - SI.L1-3.14.2

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** SI.L1-3.14.2
**Control Question:** Does the organization utilize antimalware technologies to detect and eradicate malicious code?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-END-0004
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization utilizes antimalware technologies to detect and eradicate malicious code.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must ensure that at least 95% of endpoints have current antimalware signatures updated within the past 24 hours.
    * **Provided Evidence:** OSquery results showing that 95% of endpoints have current antimalware signatures updated within the past 24 hours.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery for endpoint data.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM endpoints WHERE last_signature_update >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 DAY' AND antimalware_signature_status = 'current';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided OSquery results confirm that the requirement is met, with the necessary percentage of endpoints having updated signatures.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Generate automated logs from antimalware solutions capturing detection and remediation activities.
