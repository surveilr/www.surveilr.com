You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: SC.L1-3.13.5 (FII: FII-SCF-NET-0006). 

## Policy Structure
The policy must follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Ensure that References subsections do NOT appear after each policy section; the document should end with exactly ONE References section.

## Document Requirements
1. **Introduction**: Clearly state the purpose and importance of network segmentation in protecting systems, applications, and services.
2. **Policy Statement**: Define the organizational stance on implementing network segmentation.
3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role involved in network segmentation.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".
   - Explain how evidence will be collected and validated, prioritizing machine attestability.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** established.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for handling any exceptions to the policy.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review**.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require acknowledgment and attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

## Attestation Guidance
- For **Machine Attestation**: Describe practical methods such as using OSquery to verify network segmentation configurations.
- For **Human Attestation**: Define specific actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr.

## Operational Detail and Specificity
Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, along with a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

## Keyword Emphasis
Ensure the policy text explicitly uses and **BOLDs** the following keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

### References
The document must have exactly ONE References section at the end, and if no external references exist, output "None". 

Ensure compliance with all requirements outlined above to achieve a 100% compliance score.
