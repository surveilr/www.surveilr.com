You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

- **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
- **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
    - **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
    - **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
    - **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
- **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
    - **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
    - **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
    - **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
- **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

- **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
- **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization mandates that all Internet-bound network traffic must be routed through a proxy device. This routing will enforce URL content filtering and DNS filtering to mitigate risks associated with accessing harmful websites and to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and standards."
  - Control Code: AC.L2-3.1.3
  - Control Question: Does the organization force Internet-bound network traffic through a proxy device (e.g., Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)) for URL content filtering and DNS filtering to limit a user's ability to connect to dangerous or prohibited Internet sites?
  - Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-NET-0018
- **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
  "This policy outlines the framework for enforcing Internet-bound network traffic through a proxy device for URL content filtering and DNS filtering. The aim is to safeguard the organizationâ€™s digital assets by limiting users' ability to connect to dangerous or prohibited Internet sites."
- **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Automated logs from the proxy device showing Internet-bound traffic filtering activities and a signed document from the IT manager validating the monthly review of these logs."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AC.L2-3.1.3

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** AC.L2-3.1.3
**Control Question:** Does the organization force Internet-bound network traffic through a proxy device (e.g., Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)) for URL content filtering and DNS filtering to limit a user's ability to connect to dangerous or prohibited Internet sites?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-NET-0018
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization mandates that all Internet-bound network traffic must be routed through a proxy device. This routing will enforce URL content filtering and DNS filtering to mitigate risks associated with accessing harmful websites and to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and standards.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** All Internet-bound traffic must be routed through an approved proxy device for URL content and DNS filtering.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated logs from the proxy device showing Internet-bound traffic filtering activities.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated collection of logs from the proxy device confirming filtering activities.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM proxy_logs WHERE traffic_status = 'filtered' AND date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-07-28';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided logs confirm that 100% of Internet-bound traffic is being routed through the proxy device, as evidenced by automated logging of filtering activities.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Monthly review of filtered traffic logs must occur, with documented evidence of compliance.
    * **Provided Evidence:** A signed document from the IT manager validating the monthly review of these logs.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Record of human attestation stored in Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** N/A (human attestation).
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed document from the IT manager serves as valid human attestation confirming that the review of filtered traffic logs occurred as required.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Validation of the monthly review of filtered traffic logs.
    * **Provided Evidence:** A signed document from the IT manager.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** The IT manager must sign off on the monthly review of filtered traffic logs to validate compliance.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The signed document has been stored in Surveilr as evidence of human attestation.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed document by the IT manager validates that the human action required for compliance has been completed.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The evidence shows that all Internet-bound traffic is being routed through the proxy device for filtering, addressing the intent to mitigate risks associated with harmful website access.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None identified.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit findings indicate full compliance with the control requirements as all evidence shows adherence to both the literal requirements and the spirit of the control.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * N/A (All required evidence was provided.)
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * N/A (All evidence is compliant.)
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * N/A (No actions are required as the audit result is a PASS.)
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** N/A (No re-audit needed as the current audit result is a PASS.)
