You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization enforces Logical Access Control (LAC) permissions that conform to the principle of 'least privilege.'"
Control Code: AC.L1-3.1.1
Control Question: Does the organization enforce Logical Access Control (LAC) permissions that conform to the principle of "least privilege?"
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-IAC-0020
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for enforcing Logical Access Control (LAC) permissions within the organization in alignment with the principle of 'least privilege.' This principle ensures that individuals have only the access necessary to perform their job functions, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems. By adhering to this policy, the organization can enhance its security posture, protect sensitive data, and comply with regulatory requirements. The organization mandates that all access to information systems and resources is controlled based on the 'least privilege' principle. Access permissions will be granted strictly based on job responsibilities and the necessity to perform assigned tasks."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Evidence consists of API integrations with cloud/SaaS providers to automate the validation of user access permissions, scheduled queries against asset inventories to verify that access controls are aligned with current user roles, and documented quarterly reviews of user access permissions with standard reports uploaded to Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report  (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AC.L1-3.1.1

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** AC.L1-3.1.1
**Control Question:** Does the organization enforce Logical Access Control (LAC) permissions that conform to the principle of "least privilege?"
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-IAC-0020
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization enforces Logical Access Control (LAC) permissions that conform to the principle of 'least privilege.'

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization shall enforce logical access control permissions by regularly validating user access rights against defined job functions, ensuring compliance with the least privilege principle.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Evidence consists of API integrations with cloud/SaaS providers to automate the validation of user access permissions.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** API calls to cloud services for validating user access permissions.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM user_access WHERE role = 'defined' AND compliance_status = 'valid';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence provided shows that user access permissions are validated against their job functions using API integrations, aligning with the least privilege principle.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Scheduled queries against asset inventories to verify that access controls are aligned with current user roles.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Scheduled queries conducted against the asset inventory.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** SQL queries scheduled to run against the asset inventory database.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM asset_inventory WHERE access_role <> current_role;
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The scheduled queries validate that access controls remain aligned with user roles, ensuring ongoing compliance.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Quarterly review of user access permissions.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Documented quarterly reviews of user access permissions.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Compliance Officer or designated personnel conducting the review.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Reports uploaded and tagged in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The documented reviews are present, demonstrating adherence to the quarterly requirement and are properly recorded in Surveilr.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent and Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided demonstrates that the organization enforces logical access control permissions in alignment with the principle of least privilege.
* **Justification:** The combination of machine attestable evidence and documented human attestation collectively supports the control's intent effectively.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None observed; all aspects of the control were adequately addressed.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit findings indicate that the organization has successfully implemented and maintained access controls consistent with the least privilege principle, as evidenced by both machine attestable data and human attestations.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [For a hypothetical fail case, state exactly what is needed.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [For a hypothetical fail case, clearly state why it is non-compliant and what specific correction is required.]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [For a hypothetical fail case, list precise steps a human auditor or compliance officer needs to take.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [Outline the process for re-submission of the corrected/missing evidence for re-evaluation.]
