You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "AC.L2-3.1.17" (FII: "FII-SCF-NET-0015.1"). 

### Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**: Clearly define the purpose of the policy regarding the protection of wireless access through authentication and strong encryption.
2. **Policy Statement**: Articulate the organization's stance on wireless access security.
3. **Scope**: Explicitly state the policy's applicability to all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in wireless access security, linking to related organizational plans as necessary.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings for each requirement:
   - 1. **REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement for protecting wireless access.
   - 2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe practical, automatable methods, such as using OSquery to collect wireless configuration data or API integrations for validating encryption standards.
   - 3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr, such as manager sign-offs on wireless access reports.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation that are directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** from the previous section.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the justification and approval process.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.
10. **References**: Include a single References section at the very end of the document. Do not include References subsections within any individual policy section.

### Formatting Instructions

- Use **H2 headings (##)** for each major requirement section.
- Incorporate standard Markdown elements: paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
- Ensure that each section contains **SMART**, specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound instructions.
- Emphasize **KPIs/SLAs**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** by using bold text.
- The document must not contain any SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code, and should not have any References subsections within policy sections.

The policy document must conclude with exactly ONE References section.
