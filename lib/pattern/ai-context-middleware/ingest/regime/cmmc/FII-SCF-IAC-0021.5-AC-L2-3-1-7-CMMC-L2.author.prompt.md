You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.7 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0021.5). 

The policy document must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References.** 

1. **Introduction**: Provide a clear overview of the policy, including its purpose and importance in preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on preventing non-privileged users from altering or circumventing security safeguards.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's applicability, ensuring it covers all relevant entities, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

4. **Responsibilities**: Outline specific, task-level duties for each role involved, using **Action Verb + Frequency**. Clearly link responsibilities to relevant organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use the structure:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable evidence collection methods, emphasizing how evidence can be ingested into Surveilr.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Provide specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr for human attestation where automation is impractical.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Define clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to **SMART** objectives and **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Describe the process for handling exceptions to this policy, including documentation requirements.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure the policy maximizes machine attestability by including attestation methods in every section. Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, and bold text for emphasis. Do NOT include References subsections within individual policy sections; these should only appear in the final **References** section. 

End the policy document with exactly ONE **References** section.
