# Policy Document for CMMC Control CA.L2-3.12.4

## Introduction
Control CA.L2-3.12.4 mandates organizations to generate System Security & Privacy Plans (SSPPs) to identify and maintain key architectural information regarding critical systems, applications, and services. This control is essential for ensuring that organizations have a comprehensive understanding of their security posture and privacy measures. By maintaining SSPPs, organizations can effectively manage risks, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, and provide a historical record of data origins and processing.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to the generation and maintenance of System Security & Privacy Plans (SSPPs) for all critical systems, applications, and services. This policy outlines the processes for documenting architectural information, ensuring that all relevant data is systematically captured, maintained, and reviewed to support the organization's security and compliance objectives.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit data

## Responsibilities
- **System Owners**: Generate SSPPs **Quarterly** for all critical systems.
- **Compliance Officers**: Review and update SSPPs **Annually** to ensure alignment with regulatory requirements.
- **IT Security Personnel**: Maintain and store SSPP documents in the designated repository **Ongoing**.
- **Data Custodians**: Ensure all architectural information is collected and documented **Monthly**.
- **Auditors**: Conduct audits of SSPP compliance and documentation **Semi-Annually**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must generate and maintain SSPPs that detail the security and privacy measures for each critical system, application, or service.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Implement automated ingestion of SSPP documents into the Surveilr platform to ensure real-time updates and tracking.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Workforce members must submit signed attestations regarding their understanding of and compliance with SSPP requirements, which will be ingested into Surveilr as part of the compliance documentation process.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated against the following KPIs/SLAs:
- 100% of critical systems must have an up-to-date SSPP.
- SSPPs must be reviewed and updated within the defined review period of **Annually**.
- Audit findings related to SSPPs must show a compliance rate of at least 95% during each semi-annual audit.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and submitted to the Compliance Officer for review. The documentation should include the reason for the exception, the affected systems, and the duration of the exception. Approval for exceptions must be obtained prior to implementation.

## Lifecycle Requirements
Evidence related to SSPP generation and maintenance must be retained for a period of **five years**. SSPPs and related documentation will undergo a mandatory review **Annually** to ensure they remain current and effective.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members are required to acknowledge and attest to their understanding of this policy. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for all critical actions related to the generation and maintenance of SSPPs, ensuring accountability and traceability.
