You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization performs inventories of technology assets that accurately reflect the current systems, applications, and services in use; identifies authorized software products, including business justification details; is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; includes organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve effective property accountability; and is available for review and audit by designated organizational personnel."
  * **Control Code:** CM.L2-3.4.1
  * **Control Question:** Does the organization perform inventories of technology assets that:
     ▪ Accurately reflects the current systems, applications and services in use; 
     ▪ Identifies authorized software products, including business justification details;
     ▪ Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting;
     ▪ Includes organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve effective property accountability; and
     ▪ Is available for review and audit by designated organizational personnel?
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-AST-0002
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for maintaining accurate inventories of technology assets within the organization. An effective technology asset inventory is crucial for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, enhancing security posture, and enabling efficient resource management. By maintaining an up-to-date inventory, the organization can effectively track its systems, applications, and services, ensuring that only authorized software products are in use and that all assets are accounted for."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "OSquery results showing daily asset inventories, API integration logs validating authorized software products, signed quarterly inventory validation reports by department managers, and documentation of annual reviews of the asset inventory process."

**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-AST-0002
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization performs inventories of technology assets that accurately reflect the current systems, applications, and services in use; identifies authorized software products, including business justification details; is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; includes organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve effective property accountability; and is available for review and audit by designated organizational personnel.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must maintain accurate inventories of technology assets that reflect current systems, applications, and services in use.
    * **Provided Evidence:** OSquery results showing daily asset inventories.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery for endpoint data.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM asset_inventory WHERE updated_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 DAY';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The OSquery results demonstrate that all technology assets are recorded daily, meeting the requirement for real-time updates.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization must identify authorized software products and document business justifications for their use.
    * **Provided Evidence:** API integration logs validating authorized software products.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** API calls to software management tools.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM authorized_software WHERE validated_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 MONTH';
