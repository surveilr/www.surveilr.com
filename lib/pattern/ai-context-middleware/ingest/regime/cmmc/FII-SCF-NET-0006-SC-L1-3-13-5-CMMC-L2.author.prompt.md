You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: SC.L1-3.13.5 (FII: FII-SCF-NET-0006). 

The policy must follow this structure:

## Introduction
- Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance in network segmentation for isolating systems, applications, and services.

## Policy Statement
- State the organization's commitment to implementing network segmentation.

## Scope
- Define the policy's scope explicitly to include cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review) using **Action Verb + Frequency** format. 

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT:
   - Describe the network segmentation requirement.
   
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Use OSquery to validate network configuration and segmentation settings daily").

3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - Specify the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr (e.g., "Network Architect must sign the quarterly segmentation validation report, uploaded to Surveilr with metadata").

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

## Exceptions
- Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for documenting them.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail **Data Retention** requirements for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- State the requirements for workforce member acknowledgment/attestation, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

### References
- Include any external references used in the policy in the format [Link Text](URL), or state "None" if no external references exist.

**IMPORTANT:** Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability with clear attestation guidance in every section. Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections; the References section should be the final section of the document.
