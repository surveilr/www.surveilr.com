You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PE.L1-3.10.5 (FII: FII-SCF-PES-0004). 

Please generate a comprehensive policy document adhering to the following structure and instructions:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy MUST follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.**

2. **Attestation Guidance**: 
   - For each section, explain the control requirement, suggest machine attestation methods, and suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable. 
   - Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections. All References must ONLY appear in the final section of the document.

3. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanctions, and specify time-bound metrics (KPIs/SLA).

4. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

5. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

6. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when needed.

7. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned in the Responsibilities section. Link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

8. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

11. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

12. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

13. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

14. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

15. **References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end. 

16. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text MUST explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

17. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content.**

Please ensure that the final document includes no References subsections within individual policy sections, and the References section appears only at the end of the document.
