You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "SC.L2-3.13.8" (FII: "FII-SCF-CRY-0003"). 

## Introduction
- Explain the importance of utilizing cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of data being transmitted.

## Policy Statement
- Define the organization's commitment to implementing cryptographic protections for data in transit.

## Scope
- Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved in the implementation and oversight of the policy.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT: Describe the necessity of implementing cryptographic mechanisms for data transmission.
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: 
   - Suggest practical methods for automated evidence collection, such as using Surveilr to track cryptographic configurations and validate their application to data in transit.
3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: 
   - Define the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr, such as signed approval from the IT Security team on encryption settings.

## Verification Criteria
- Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

## Exceptions
- Outline any exceptions to the policy, including their documentation and approval processes.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail the **Data Retention** periods for logs and evidence, and mandate an **Annual Review** of the policy.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance and mandate comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.
