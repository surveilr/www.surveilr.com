# Data Protection Controls Policy

## Introduction
This policy outlines the organizationâ€™s commitment to implementing data protection controls in alignment with CMMC control MP.L2-3.8.1. The integrity, confidentiality, and availability of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) are paramount to our operations. This policy ensures that our data handling practices meet regulatory requirements and safeguard sensitive information against unauthorized access and breaches.

## Policy Statement
The organization is dedicated to establishing robust data protection controls that comply with applicable standards and regulations. We will implement measures that ensure the secure handling of ePHI across all systems, applications, and interactions, thereby reinforcing our commitment to protecting sensitive data.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who handle ePHI.
- All environments including on-premises systems, cloud-hosted solutions, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

- **Relevant**: All systems handling ePHI must be included in the asset inventory.
- **Time-bound**: Compliance must be demonstrated through the collection of evidence within the specified reporting periods.

- **Annual Review**: This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure continued relevance and compliance.
