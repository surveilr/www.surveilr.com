## Introduction

This policy outlines the framework for monitoring and controlling communications at the external network boundary and key internal boundaries within the organization. It is essential to ensure the security and integrity of sensitive information, particularly electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), as it traverses various networks. Effective monitoring and control mechanisms are critical to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and data breaches, thereby protecting the organization's assets and maintaining compliance with relevant regulations.

## Policy Statement

The organization is committed to maintaining high standards of network security through diligent monitoring and control of communications. This includes implementing measures to safeguard ePHI and other sensitive information from unauthorized access and ensuring that all network communications comply with established security protocols. All employees and contractors are expected to adhere to this policy to foster a secure operating environment.

## Scope

This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:

- On-premises systems
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems

The policy encompasses all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the organization's network security posture.

## Responsibilities

- **IT Security Team + Daily**: Monitor network traffic and alerts for suspicious activities and anomalies.
- **Compliance Officer + Quarterly**: Review and update network security policies and practices in line with regulatory requirements.
- **Network Administrators + Weekly**: Implement and maintain security controls at the external and internal network boundaries.
- **All Employees + Ongoing**: Report any suspicious network activity or potential security incidents to the IT Security Team.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**: Monitor and control external network communications.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) to log and analyze incoming and outgoing traffic.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Security analysts perform weekly reviews of NIDS logs and document findings in Surveilr.

2. **REQUIREMENT**: Monitor key internal boundaries.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Deploy firewalls configured to log access attempts and traffic flow across internal segments.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Network Administrators conduct monthly validation of firewall logs and submit reports to the Compliance Officer.

## Verification Criteria

- Compliance will be measured against **SMART** objectives, ensuring that monitoring tools are operational 99% of the time, and that incidents are logged and addressed within 24 hours.
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will include:
  - Number of unauthorized access attempts detected and mitigated.
  - Time taken to respond to security incidents (SLAs).
  
## Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. A formal request must be submitted, detailing the rationale for the exception, and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

## Lifecycle Requirements

- **Data Retention**: All logs and evidence collected must be retained for a minimum of 3 years to meet compliance and audit requirements.
- **Annual Review**: The policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness, with updates made as necessary.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging of critical actions will be maintained, and formal documentation must be created for any exceptions granted.
