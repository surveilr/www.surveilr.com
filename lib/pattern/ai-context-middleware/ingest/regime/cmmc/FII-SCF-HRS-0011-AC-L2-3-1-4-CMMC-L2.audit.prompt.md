You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To prevent inappropriate activities within the organization without collusion, the organization implements and maintains Separation of Duties (SoD)."
      - Control Code: AC.L2-3.1.4
      - Control Question: Does the organization implement and maintain Separation of Duties (SoD) to prevent potential inappropriate activity without collusion?
      - Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-HRS-0011
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "Separation of Duties (SoD) is a critical internal control mechanism designed to prevent inappropriate activities within our organization without collusion. By distributing responsibilities across multiple individuals, SoD helps mitigate the risk of fraud, error, and unauthorized access to sensitive information, including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). This policy ensures that no single individual has the authority to execute all phases of a critical process, thus safeguarding our organizationâ€™s integrity and compliance with applicable regulations."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** 
    "1. Daily OSquery logs demonstrating user access rights across all systems for the past month. 
    2. Signed quarterly review documentation by the Compliance Officer approving the current SoD compliance status. 
    3. Documentation from HR showing updated roles and responsibilities related to SoD."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report  (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AC.L2-3.1.4

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** AC.L2-3.1.4
**Control Question:** Does the organization implement and maintain Separation of Duties (SoD) to prevent potential inappropriate activity without collusion?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-HRS-0011
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To prevent inappropriate activities within the organization without collusion, the organization implements and maintains Separation of Duties (SoD).

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Daily collection of user access logs to verify compliance with SoD policies.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Daily OSquery logs demonstrating user access rights across all systems for the past month.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Evidence collected using OSquery for endpoint data.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM user_access_logs WHERE access_date >= '2025-06-01' AND access_date <= '2025-06-30';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided OSquery logs show that user access rights were reviewed daily, meeting the expected evidence for machine attestation.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Documentation of user access reviews.
    * **Provided Evidence:** [Reference to the specific machine-attestable evidence provided in the input for this requirement, or clear statement of its absence.]
