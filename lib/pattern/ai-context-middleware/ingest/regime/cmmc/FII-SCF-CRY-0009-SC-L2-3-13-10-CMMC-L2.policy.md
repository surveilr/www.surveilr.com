# Cryptographic Key Management Policy

## 1. Introduction
This policy aims to establish robust cryptographic key management controls that are vital for protecting the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** of our organization's cryptographic keys. Effective key management ensures that keys are created, stored, and destroyed securely, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

## 2. Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to maintaining the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** of cryptographic keys through stringent management practices. We will adhere to all applicable regulations and standards to ensure the protection of sensitive information assets.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all entities and environments involved in the creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of cryptographic keys, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All internal systems and channels

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Conduct a **Quarterly Review** of key management procedures and document findings.
- **IT Security**: Implement **Daily Monitoring** of key access logs and report any anomalies immediately.
- **System Administrators**: Ensure that cryptographic keys are generated, stored, and destroyed according to documented procedures.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
- **1. REQUIREMENT**: Implement cryptographic key management controls that enforce secure generation, storage, and lifecycle management of keys.
  
- **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Collect key usage logs via **API integration** with the key management system to automate evidence collection and ensure real-time monitoring.
  
- **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The **Security Manager** must sign off on the **Annual Review** of key management procedures and maintain a documented report as evidence of compliance.

## 6. Verification Criteria
All key management processes must be verified **Quarterly** with a documented report demonstrating compliance against defined **KPIs/SLAs**, including:
- 100% of key access logs reviewed and validated.
- No unauthorized access incidents reported over the review period.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented in writing and submitted to the Compliance Officer for approval. All exceptions must include a justification and will be reviewed during the **Annual Review**.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
Key management logs and evidence must be retained for a minimum of **5 years**. The key management policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging must be maintained for all key management actions, including key issuance, usage, and destruction.
