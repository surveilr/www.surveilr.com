You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PE.L1-3.10.3 (FII: FII-SCF-PES-0006). 

The policy must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. Ensure that **References subsections do NOT appear within individual policy sections.**

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Each process must include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Clearly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed)**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr for any human attestation required.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section must define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned. Explicitly link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

9. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods and avoid writing or embedding SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

10. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

11. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

12. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

13. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the end. 

14. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

15. **Final Section Requirements**: Ensure the **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document** and contains either external references or the line "None" if there are no references.

Now, proceed to author the policy content as per these guidelines, ensuring that it is robust, clear, and maximizes machine attestability through Surveilr.
