You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: MA.L2-3.7.3 (FII: FII-SCF-DCH-0009). 

The policy document must follow the mandatory structure outlined below, ensuring to maximize machine attestability. Each section must include clear explanations of the control requirements, as well as detailed machine and human attestation methods. Ensure that human attestation is specified only when automation is impractical. 

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

2. **Policy Sections**:
   - Each section should begin with an H2 heading (##).
   - Include operational detail with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions.
   - For processes such as containment, correction, or violation sanction, include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).
   - The **Scope** must explicitly define all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems and third-party vendor systems.
   - The **Responsibilities** section must define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned.
   - The **Evidence Collection Methods** must be structured with numbered subheadings: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".
   - **Verification Criteria** must include clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.
   - Emphasize machine attestation methods and include precise actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr for human attestation when necessary.

3. **Attestation Guidance**: 
   - For **Machine Attestation**, provide practical, automatable methods.
   - For **Human Attestation**, describe the exact action required, the artifact to be created, and how it will be documented in Surveilr.

4. **Documentation**: 
   - Ensure to include a **Data Retention** section detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.
   - Include a **Formal Documentation and Audit** section requiring workforce member acknowledgment/attestation and comprehensive audit logging for critical actions.

5. **Prohibited Content**: Do not include SQL queries or embed code blocks. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

6. **Final Section**: The document must end with exactly ONE References section. Ensure that this is the only place where references are listed, and that no References subsections appear after each policy section.

Ensure to bold the following keywords throughout the policy where applicable: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.
