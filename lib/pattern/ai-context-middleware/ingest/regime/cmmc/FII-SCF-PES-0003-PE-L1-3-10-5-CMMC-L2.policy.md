# Physical Access Authorization Policy

## Introduction
This policy establishes the framework for enforcing physical access authorizations to facilities within the organization. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive areas, thereby safeguarding our assets, information, and personnel. Effective enforcement of physical access control is vital in mitigating risks related to unauthorized access, ensuring operational integrity, and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to enforcing strict physical access authorizations at all access points to its facilities. This commitment includes implementing controls to monitor, manage, and restrict access based on verified authorization levels to protect sensitive information and physical assets.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to physical facilities, cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems. It encompasses all channels utilized for creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting sensitive information.

## Responsibilities
- **Conduct** physical security assessments **annually** to identify vulnerabilities and improve access controls.
- **Review** access authorization logs **monthly** to ensure compliance with defined access levels.
- **Update** access permissions **immediately** upon role changes or terminations of employees.
- **Train** staff on physical access protocols **biannually** to ensure awareness and adherence to policies.
- **Monitor** surveillance footage **continuously** to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must ensure that physical access authorizations are established and enforced at all entry and exit points to facilities. This includes maintaining a comprehensive log of all access permissions and changes to ensure accountability and traceability.
   
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automated methods for evidence collection shall include:
   - Utilizing access control systems that generate logs of all entry and exit events, which can be ingested into Surveilr.
   - Implementing electronic surveillance systems that capture and store footage of access points, with metadata that verifies the time and identity of individuals entering or exiting.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: The organization will maintain a signed access authorization log that documents who has been granted access and for what purpose. This log must be uploaded to Surveilr and reviewed as part of the compliance checks.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through measurable criteria including:
- **Access Logs**: 100% of access logs must be reviewed for anomalies monthly.
- **Audit Findings**: No more than 2% of access authorizations should be found to be non-compliant during annual audits.
- **Response Time**: All unauthorized access incidents must be responded to within 24 hours.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and submitted for approval. The request must outline the rationale for the exception and be reviewed by the physical security management team. Approved exceptions will be logged and monitored for compliance with any stipulated conditions.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Access control logs and surveillance footage must be retained for a minimum of three years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an annual review to ensure its relevance and effectiveness, with updates made as necessary to address emerging risks or changes in regulatory requirements.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding of and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs shall be maintained for critical actions related to physical access, and formal documentation must be created for all approved exceptions to this policy.
