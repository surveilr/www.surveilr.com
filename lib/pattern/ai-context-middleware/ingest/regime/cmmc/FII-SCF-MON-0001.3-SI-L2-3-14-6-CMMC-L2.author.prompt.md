You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "SI.L2-3.14.6" (FII: "FII-SCF-MON-0001.3"). 

## Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the policy's purpose regarding the continuous monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to monitoring communications traffic and maintaining compliance.

3. **Scope**: Define the policyâ€™s scope, explicitly including **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and **all channels** used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify the roles and their **Action Verb + Frequency** duties related to this policy, ensuring to include detailed responsibilities for compliance officers, IT security personnel, and other relevant roles.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 

   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement to continuously monitor communications traffic.
   
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest machine attestability methods such as using automated tools to analyze traffic logs and detect anomalies, with specific examples like "Ingest traffic monitoring logs into Surveilr daily for anomaly detection."
   
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define actions such as "The cybersecurity manager must review and sign monthly traffic analysis reports," and specify how this will be documented and ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **SMART** metrics and **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any permissible exceptions to the policy, including the documentation and approval process for such exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, and mandate comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, including documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Conclude the document with a single **References** section that lists all external links using the [Link Text](URL) format, ensuring no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

Ensure the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes specific operational details, and follows the mandated structure without including SQL queries or code snippets. Emphasize the importance of **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** in the policy content.
