You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure that privileged accounts are protected through Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to reduce the risk of unauthorized access."
Control Code: IA.L2-3.5.3,
Control Question: Does the organization utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to authenticate local access for privileged accounts?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-IAC-0006.3
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy establishes the requirements for utilizing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to authenticate local access for privileged accounts within the organization. The organization mandates the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all privileged accounts accessing local systems to safeguard sensitive information and systems against unauthorized access."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "MFA logs showing access attempts for privileged accounts, including timestamps, user IDs, and authentication methods used, stored in Surveilr; signed acknowledgment forms from end users confirming understanding of MFA requirements."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report  (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - IA.L2-3.5.3

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** CMMC Auditor
**Control Code:** IA.L2-3.5.3
**Control Question:** Does the organization utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to authenticate local access for privileged accounts?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-IAC-0006.3
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To ensure that privileged accounts are protected through Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Maintain logs of all privileged account access attempts, including successful and unsuccessful MFA authentications.
    * **Provided Evidence:** MFA logs showing access attempts for privileged accounts, including timestamps, user IDs, and authentication methods used.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated tools to collect and validate MFA logs.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM MFA_Logs WHERE account_type = 'privileged';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence provided shows comprehensive logs that meet the requirements of the control.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** 100% adherence to MFA implementation for all privileged accounts.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Documentation confirming that all privileged accounts have MFA configured.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Verification through configuration management tools feeding into Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Privileged_Accounts WHERE MFA_Enabled = TRUE;
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** All privileged accounts are confirmed to have MFA implementation verified by the logs.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** End users must complete an acknowledgment form regarding their understanding of MFA requirements.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed acknowledgment forms from end users confirming understanding of MFA requirements.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** End users signed acknowledging MFA requirements.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Stored signed forms in Surveilr for compliance tracking.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** All necessary signed forms are present and stored correctly.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent and Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The organization shows robust compliance with MFA requirements, ensuring protection against unauthorized access to privileged accounts.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None identified.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence collected shows full compliance with both the literal requirements and the intent of the control, demonstrating effective use of MFA for privileged accounts.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [For each missing piece of evidence identified in Section 2, state *exactly* what is needed.]
    * [Specify the required format/type for each missing piece.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
