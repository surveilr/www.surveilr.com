# Mobile Device Management (MDM) Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish comprehensive controls for Mobile Device Management (MDM) within our organization. This policy is designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI) by ensuring that all mobile devices accessing organizational resources are properly managed and secured. By implementing robust MDM controls, we can mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access, data breaches, and non-compliance with regulatory standards.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to implementing and governing **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** controls to ensure that all mobile devices accessing organizational data comply with security standards and best practices. This policy mandates the deployment of MDM solutions to provide secure access to ePHI, enforce security policies, and monitor compliance. We aim to protect sensitive information while enabling the functionality required for organizational operations.

## Scope
This policy applies to all personnel, including employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who utilize mobile devices to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. It encompasses all relevant entities and environments, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used in mobile device communications

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team:** 
  - **Implement** MDM solutions **Quarterly** to ensure compliance with security policies.
  - **Monitor** mobile device compliance **Weekly** to identify and remediate non-compliance issues.
  - **Review** MDM configurations and policies **Annually** for relevance and effectiveness.

- **Compliance Officer:** 
  - **Audit** MDM practices and policies **Semi-Annually** to verify adherence to this policy.
  - **Report** findings and compliance metrics **Monthly** to stakeholders.

- **All Employees:** 
  - **Attend** MDM training sessions **Bi-Annually** to remain informed about mobile security practices.
  - **Notify** the IT Security Team **Immediately** upon discovery of a lost or stolen device.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT:
The organization must implement MDM solutions that enforce security policies on all mobile devices accessing ePHI.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
- Automated compliance checks will be conducted by MDM software to verify that devices are compliant with established security policies. 
- Device logs will be collected and analyzed for compliance metrics, including device encryption and security patch levels.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
- Employees must complete and submit a compliance attestation form via Surveilr after attending MDM training sessions.
- The IT Security Team must document any instances of non-compliance and remediation efforts in Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through **SMART** criteria:
- **Specific:** All mobile devices must be enrolled in the MDM system.
- **Measurable:** 95% of mobile devices must demonstrate compliance with security policies.
- **Achievable:** Compliance rates will be reviewed against industry benchmarks.
- **Relevant:** Mobile devices must adhere to organizational security standards for ePHI.
- **Time-bound:** Compliance audits will occur **Quarterly**.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and reviewed by the Compliance Officer. The process includes:
- Submitting a formal exception request detailing the rationale and duration.
- Receiving written approval from the Compliance Officer.
- Maintaining a record of all approved exceptions in Surveilr for auditing purposes.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** Logs and evidence related to MDM compliance must be retained for a minimum of **3 years**.
- **Annual Review:** This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **Annually** to ensure relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding of this policy through a digital signature in Surveilr.
- Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for all critical actions related to MDM controls, including access logs and compliance checks.
- Formal documentation for all exceptions must be retained and made available for audit purposes.
