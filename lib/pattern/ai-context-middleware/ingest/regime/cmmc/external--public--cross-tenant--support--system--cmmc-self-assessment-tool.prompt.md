# CMMC Self-Assessment Tool: Lead Magnet Strategy for Netspective

## What is the CMMC Self-Assessment Tool?

The CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) Self-Assessment Tool is a comprehensive digital platform designed to help organizations evaluate their cybersecurity maturity in alignment with U.S. Department of Defense and federal contractor requirements. The tool guides companies through structured assessments across seven critical cybersecurity domains:

1. **Access Control (AC)** - Managing user permissions and system access
2. **Identification & Authentication (IA)** - Verifying user and system identities
3. **Media Protection (MP)** - Securing data storage and transmission media
4. **Physical Protection (PE)** - Safeguarding physical infrastructure and assets
5. **System & Communications Protection (SC)** - Securing network communications
6. **System & Information Integrity (SI)** - Maintaining data accuracy and system reliability
7. **Policy Framework (PF)** - Establishing governance and compliance policies

## Key Tool Capabilities
