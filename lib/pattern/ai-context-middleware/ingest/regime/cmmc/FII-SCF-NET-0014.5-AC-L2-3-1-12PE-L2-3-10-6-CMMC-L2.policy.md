Compliance will be measured against the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- 100% completion of remote access security training by all employees **Annually**.
- Zero unauthorized access attempts recorded in logging systems over a **12-month period**.
- 100% of employees submitting device security compliance checklists **Monthly**.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the IT Security Team. Documentation of exceptions must include justification and a remediation plan, stored in Surveilr.
