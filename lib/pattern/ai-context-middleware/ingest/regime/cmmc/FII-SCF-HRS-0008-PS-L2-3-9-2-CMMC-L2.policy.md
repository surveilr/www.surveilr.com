# Access Authorization Adjustment Policy

## 1. Introduction
This policy outlines the procedures and responsibilities for adjusting logical and physical access authorizations in response to personnel reassignment or transfer. Ensuring timely updates to access authorizations is critical for maintaining the security of systems and facilities, thereby protecting sensitive information and resources from unauthorized access.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to **timely** adjusting access authorizations for all personnel upon reassignment or transfer. This policy aims to ensure that access rights are aligned with current roles and responsibilities, mitigating potential security risks associated with outdated access permissions.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all personnel, systems, and facilities involved in access management within the organization. It governs the access authorizations for all employees, contractors, and third-party users who interact with organizational resources.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Human Resources (HR)**: 
  - **Review** personnel changes **Immediately** after notification of reassignment or transfer.
  - **Notify** IT security personnel of required access changes **Within 24 hours** of personnel changes.
  
- **IT Security**:

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Access authorizations must be adjusted **timely** to reflect changes in personnel roles to prevent unauthorized access to systems and facilities.
  
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize Surveilr to track and document access changes automatically. Surveilr's audit logs will provide an immutable record of all access modifications, ensuring compliance with this policy.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Upon access changes, personnel must complete a signed acknowledgment form confirming their understanding of the adjusted access rights. This form will serve as evidence of compliance and understanding of access responsibilities.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through **SMART** criteria, including:
- Access changes completed within established timeframes (e.g., 48 hours).
- Percentage of personnel transitions successfully logged and acknowledged.
- Number of discrepancies identified during **Quarterly** audits, with a target of zero non-compliance incidents.

## 7. Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. These exceptions may include temporary access grants for special projects or emergencies. All exceptions will be recorded in the exception log and reviewed during **Monthly** compliance meetings.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to access authorizations must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness, with updates made as necessary.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
