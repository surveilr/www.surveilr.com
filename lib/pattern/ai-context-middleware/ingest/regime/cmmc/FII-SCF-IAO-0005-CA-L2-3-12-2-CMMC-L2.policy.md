# Policy Document: Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) for Control CA.L2-3.12.2

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a structured approach for the generation and management of a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to document planned remedial actions for security control deficiencies. The POA&M serves as a critical tool in identifying, tracking, and mitigating weaknesses in information assurance, ensuring the organization can effectively respond to vulnerabilities and maintain compliance with relevant standards.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to documenting weaknesses or deficiencies identified during security assessments and implementing corrective actions through the development and maintenance of a comprehensive POA&M. This policy ensures that all identified issues are addressed systematically, thereby reducing risk and enhancing the overall security posture.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party systems involved in the organizationâ€™s information assurance processes. It encompasses all environments where information systems are deployed, including on-premises, cloud-based, and hybrid systems.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and approve the POA&M bi-annually to ensure it aligns with compliance requirements.
- **IT Security**: Generate and update the POA&M within 15 days of identification of any deficiencies and oversee the implementation of corrective actions.
- **Risk Management**: Assess risks associated with deficiencies quarterly and report findings to the executive team.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: A POA&M must be generated whenever security control deficiencies are identified during assessments or audits.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automatically ingest POA&M updates into Surveilr from project management tools such as JIRA or Asana, ensuring real-time tracking of actions taken.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Upon completion of updates to the POA&M, designated personnel must sign off on the updates, with records maintained in a secure document management system.

## Verification Criteria
POA&M updates must be reviewed and approved within 30 days of the identification of deficiencies. Compliance will be validated against the following KPIs: 
- Percentage of POA&M updates completed on time.
- Number of deficiencies closed within the specified remediation timeframe.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and require written approval from the Compliance Officer. Justifications for exceptions must be clearly articulated and retained for audit purposes.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Retain POA&M records for a minimum of 6 years from the date of generation.
- **Policy Review**: This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually to reflect changes in compliance requirements and operational needs.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to the POA&M, including updates, approvals, and exceptions, to ensure accountability and traceability.
