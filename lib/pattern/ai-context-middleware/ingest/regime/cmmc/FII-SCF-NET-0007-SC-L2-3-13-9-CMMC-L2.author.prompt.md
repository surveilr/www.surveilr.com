You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: SC.L2-3.13.9 (FII: FII-SCF-NET-0007). 

The policy document must be structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy purpose and significance regarding network session termination.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on terminating network connections at the end of a session or after a defined period of inactivity.
3. **Scope**: Define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.
4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties for each role associated with this policy using **Action Verb + Frequency** language.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Explain the control requirement.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical, automatable methods for machine evidence collection and validation.
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Define specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for approval.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and a mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
10. **References**: Include a single references section at the end of the document. 

Ensure that each section follows the provided structure without including References subsections within individual policy sections. The final document must end with exactly ONE References section. Remember to use standard Markdown formatting, emphasize enforced keywords like **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** by making them bold.
