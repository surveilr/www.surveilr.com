# Multi-Factor Authentication Policy for Privileged Accounts

## Introduction
This policy establishes the requirements for utilizing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to authenticate local access for privileged accounts within the organization. As part of our commitment to maintaining robust security practices, this policy aims to safeguard sensitive information and systems against unauthorized access.

## Policy Statement
The organization mandates the use of **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all privileged accounts accessing local systems. This requirement applies to all user accounts with elevated access privileges that manage sensitive data or critical operational functions. MFA ensures that access to these accounts is protected through multiple verification factors, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- All organizational personnel who manage, maintain, or access privileged accounts.
- All environments, including:
  - On-premises systems
  - Cloud-hosted systems
  - Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
  - Third-party vendor systems
- All devices used to access privileged accounts, including desktops, laptops, and mobile devices.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team: Conducts** monthly reviews of MFA implementation and compliance.
- **System Administrators: Configure** MFA for all privileged accounts upon account creation and during routine access reviews.
- **Compliance Manager: Reviews** the policy annually for relevance and compliance with updated regulations.
- **End Users: Acknowledge** and confirm understanding of MFA requirements upon first login to privileged accounts.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   - Maintain logs of all privileged account access attempts, including successful and unsuccessful MFA authentications.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   - Utilize automated tools to collect and validate MFA logs, ensuring they include timestamps, user IDs, and authentication methods used. This data should be ingested into Surveilr for analysis.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   - End users must complete an acknowledgment form regarding their understanding of MFA requirements, which will be stored in Surveilr for compliance tracking.

## Verification Criteria
- Compliance with this policy will be validated through:
  - **100% adherence** to MFA implementation for all privileged accounts.
  - Successful authentication records must show that **99%** of all access attempts were authenticated using MFA.
  - Annual audits must confirm that all relevant personnel have acknowledged the MFA requirements.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Evidence and logs must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- This policy will be reviewed and updated on an **annual basis** to ensure continuous relevance and compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- All workforce members with privileged account access must provide an acknowledgment of understanding and compliance with this policy.
- Comprehensive audit logging will capture all critical actions related to privileged account access, including MFA authentication attempts.
- Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and approved by the Compliance Manager.
