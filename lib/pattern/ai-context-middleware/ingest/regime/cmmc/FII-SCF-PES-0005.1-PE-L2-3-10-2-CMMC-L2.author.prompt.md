You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PE.L2-3.10.2 (FII: FII-SCF-PES-0005.1). 

The policy must follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the policy's purpose and importance in ensuring compliance with physical intrusion monitoring.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to monitoring physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify task-level duties for each role involved, using **Action Verb + Frequency** (e.g., "Security Officer: daily monitoring of surveillance logs; Compliance Officer: quarterly policy review").

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement for monitoring physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automatable methods for attesting to compliance, such as: "Use API integrations to collect and validate alarm monitoring data."
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Outline necessary human actions and artifacts, e.g., "Security manager reviews and signs monthly alarm monitoring reports."

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, tied to **SMART** metrics and **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Specify any exceptions to the policy, including the justification and duration of these exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods for logs and evidence (e.g., "retain for 6 years") and the **Annual Review** frequency of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and documentation of all exceptions.

The policy must maximize machine attestability, explicitly include attestation guidance for each section, and ensure that every requirement is addressed to achieve a 100% compliance score. 

Please ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections and that the document ends with exactly ONE References section.
