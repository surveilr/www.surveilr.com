You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L1-3.1.1 (FII: FII-SCF-TPM-0005). 

The policy document must comply with the following requirements:

1. **Document Structure**: Follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Each section must include attestation guidance for both machine and human methods. Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections; the References section appears ONLY at the very end of the document.

2. **Markdown Elements**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. 

3. **Attestation Guidance**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation, as well as precise steps and artifacts for human attestation.

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions, including a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA) for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction.

5. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

6. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

7. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when automation is impractical.

8. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, linking to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

11. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

12. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

13. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

14. **Keyword Emphasis**: Explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

15. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document**. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content.

16. **References Section Format**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance for every requirement.
