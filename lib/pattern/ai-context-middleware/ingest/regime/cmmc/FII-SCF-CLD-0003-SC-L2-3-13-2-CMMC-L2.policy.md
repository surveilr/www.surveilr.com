# CMMC Compliance Policy for Control SC.L2-3.13.2

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements for hosting security-specific technologies in a dedicated subnet, as mandated by CMMC Control SC.L2-3.13.2. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all security-related systems are isolated to enhance security posture and mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## Policy Statement
The organization shall host all security-specific technologies within a dedicated subnet to ensure enhanced security and compliance with CMMC requirements. This dedicated subnet will be monitored and managed to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data, including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - Ensure the configuration of dedicated subnets for security technologies.
  - Monitor and maintain the integrity of the subnet.
- **Network Administrators**: 
  - Implement and manage the network segmentation.
  - Conduct regular assessments of the subnet's security posture.
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - Oversee adherence to this policy.
  - Coordinate the **Annual Review** of the policy.
  
Each role is responsible for escalating issues as per the organization's incident response plan and ensuring compliance with recovery and disciplinary actions.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT:
Host security-specific technologies in a dedicated subnet.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
- Utilize network monitoring tools to verify that all security technologies are deployed within the designated subnet.
- Implement automated alerts for any unauthorized devices attempting to connect to the subnet.
- Use Surveilr to ingest network configuration data and validate subnet assignments on a daily basis.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
- The IT Security Manager must sign the monthly subnet configuration report to validate compliance with this policy.
- The signed report must be uploaded to Surveilr for record-keeping and future audits.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- **100%** of security technologies must be hosted in the dedicated subnet.
- Monthly reports must be signed and uploaded to Surveilr within **5 business days** of the end of each month.
- Unauthorized access attempts must be logged and reviewed within **24 hours** of detection.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. All exceptions will be formally recorded and reviewed during the **Annual Review** process.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All logs and evidence related to subnet configurations and access attempts must be retained for a minimum of **3 years**.
- This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be implemented for all critical actions related to subnet access and configuration changes. Any exceptions must be formally documented and reviewed.
