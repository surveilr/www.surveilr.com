# Policy for Control: IA.L2-3.5.4 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0002.2)

## 1. Introduction
This policy outlines the framework for implementing automated mechanisms for replay-resistant authentication within our organization. The purpose of this policy is to safeguard electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) through robust authentication measures that prevent unauthorized access via replay attacks. Ensuring the integrity of our authentication mechanisms is vital for maintaining trust and compliance with regulatory standards.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to implementing automated mechanisms for replay-resistant authentication to enhance the security of ePHI. These mechanisms will be designed to detect and prevent unauthorized replay attempts, thereby ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access or manage systems that create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. It encompasses all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, and third-party vendor systems (Business Associates).

## 4. Responsibilities
- **IT Security**: Conduct daily log reviews to monitor authentication activities and identify potential replay attempts.
- **System Administrators**: Implement and maintain automated authentication mechanisms, performing weekly updates and patches.
- **Compliance Officer**: Review compliance with this policy on a quarterly basis and prepare reports for management.
- **All Workforce Members**: Complete annual training on replay-resistant authentication and sign acknowledgment of understanding.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization requires automated mechanisms that ensure replay-resistant authentication for all systems handling ePHI.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize OSquery to validate authentication logs and detect replay attempts automatically. Logs should include timestamps, user identifiers, and session tokens.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: When automation is impractical, the IT manager must sign a quarterly review of authentication mechanisms to confirm adherence to the policy.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- At least 95% of authentication logs must be reviewed weekly for replay attempts.
- Quarterly reviews of automated mechanisms must be conducted, with documented findings showing no unauthorized replay attempts.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. A formal exception request must include the rationale and the proposed mitigations to maintain security.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
All logs and evidence of compliance must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure it remains relevant and effective.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to authentication mechanisms to facilitate ongoing oversight and compliance verification.
