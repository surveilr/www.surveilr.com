You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "SI.L2-3.14.6" (FII: FII-SCF-NET-0008). 

The policy must be structured as follows, ensuring that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections and that the document ends with exactly ONE References section:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the purpose and importance of the policy regarding Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS).

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on employing NIDS/NIPS for detecting and preventing intrusions into the network.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, such as the Compliance Officer, IT Security personnel, and Network Administrators.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. **REQUIREMENT**: Describe the specific requirement of employing NIDS/NIPS.
   - 2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as integrating NIDS/NIPS logs into Surveilr for continuous monitoring.
   - 3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr, such as a signed report from network security personnel verifying system configuration.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for requesting and documenting exceptions to the policy, including necessary approvals.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review and updates, emphasizing the need for **Annual Review**.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a single References section at the very end of the document, ensuring no References subsections are present in any policy section.

Ensure the policy maximizes machine attestability by providing specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) instructions throughout, particularly in operational details and verification criteria. Use standard Markdown formatting, bolding all enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

End the policy document with the **References** section, and do not include control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content thereafter.
