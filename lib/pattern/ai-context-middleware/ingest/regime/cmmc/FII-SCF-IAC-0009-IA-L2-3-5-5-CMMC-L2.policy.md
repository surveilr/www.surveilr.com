The purpose of this policy is to establish and govern naming standards for usernames and systems within the organization. This ensures consistency, security, and compliance across all digital environments, especially in the context of handling electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). Adhering to these standards minimizes risks associated with unauthorized access and enhances the overall integrity of our information systems.
