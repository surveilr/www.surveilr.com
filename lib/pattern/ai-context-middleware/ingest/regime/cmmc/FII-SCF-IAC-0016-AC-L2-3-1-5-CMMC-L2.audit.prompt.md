You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "Restricting and controlling privileged access rights for users and services to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive systems and information."
Control Code: AC.L2-3.1.5
Control Question: Does the organization restrict and control privileged access rights for users and services?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-IAC-0016
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The Privileged Access Management Policy establishes principles and requirements for controlling privileged access to ePHI, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive systems and information. The policy outlines responsibilities, evidence collection methods, and verification criteria to safeguard against unauthorized access."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "1. OSquery results showing the current access rights of all privileged accounts. 2. API integration results validating access rights and permissions. 3. Signed attestation forms from managers documenting semi-annual access reviews. 4. Access log entries for the last six months showing no unauthorized access attempts."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AC.L2-3.1.5

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** AC.L2-3.1.5
**Control Question:** Does the organization restrict and control privileged access rights for users and services?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-IAC-0016
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** Restricting and controlling privileged access rights for users and services to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive systems and information.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** 100% of privileged access requests must be documented and approved before access is granted.
    * **Provided Evidence:** OSquery results showing the current access rights of all privileged accounts.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery to gather data on user access.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM privileged_access WHERE approval_status = 'approved';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The OSquery results provide a complete record of documented and approved privileged access requests, fulfilling the control's requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Access reviews must show that 90% of privileged accounts are reviewed and validated within the defined period.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed attestation forms from managers documenting semi-annual access reviews.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Human attestation records stored in the compliance documentation repository.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM access_reviews WHERE review_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-06-30';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed attestation forms demonstrate compliance with the access review frequency and validation needs.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Access logs must show no unauthorized access attempts.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Access log entries for the last six months showing no unauthorized access attempts.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Daily review of access logs by the IT Security Team.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM access_logs WHERE access_status = 'unauthorized';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The access logs confirm that there were no unauthorized access attempts, meeting the control's requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Managers must perform access reviews every six months.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed attestation forms from managers.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Managers attest to the review and approval of access rights.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Signed forms recorded in compliance documentation.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed forms indicate that managers have conducted the required reviews and documented their approval.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided demonstrates that the organization is effectively managing privileged access rights in accordance with the control's intent.
* **Justification:** The combination of machine and human attestations shows a robust approach to restricting and controlling access, aligning with the security control's underlying goals.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence provided meets all outlined requirements of the control, demonstrating an effective management of privileged access rights.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [For each missing piece of evidence identified in Section 2, state *exactly* what is needed. E.g., "Provide OSquery results for user access logs for the last quarter."]
    * [Specify the required format/type for each missing piece: e.g., "Obtain signed PDF copies of all managers' attestation forms for access reviews."]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [For each instance of non-compliant evidence identified in Section 2, clearly state *why* it is non-compliant and what *specific correction* is required. E.g., "Access logs show discrepancies; provide remediation documentation."]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [List precise steps a human auditor or compliance officer needs to take. E.g., "Engage IT Operations to retrieve the specific logs for server X from date Y."]
    * [Specify which teams or individuals are responsible for producing or correcting the evidence.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [Outline the process for re-submission of the corrected/missing evidence for re-evaluation.]
