## Introduction

The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for protecting the authenticity and integrity of communications sessions within the organization. In an increasingly digital world, safeguarding communication is paramount to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and ensuring that sensitive information is transmitted securely. This policy outlines the necessary measures to secure communications across all platforms and environments.

## Policy Statement

The organization is committed to maintaining secure communications by implementing robust controls that protect the authenticity and integrity of all communications sessions. All personnel will adhere to these guidelines to ensure that sensitive information remains confidential and secure during transmission.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors involved in the creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of sensitive information across the organizationâ€™s systems. This includes, but is not limited to, cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and any channels utilized for communication.

## Responsibilities

- **IT Security Team**: Conduct **security assessments** of communications channels **quarterly**.
- **Network Administrators**: Implement **encryption protocols** for all communications **upon deployment**.
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and update the policy **annually** to align with regulatory changes.
- **Employees**: Report any **security incidents** related to communications **immediately** to IT Security.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must ensure that all communications sessions are authenticated and integrity-verified to prevent unauthorized access and tampering.
   
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize OSquery to automate validation of encryption configurations and logging mechanisms to ensure that all sessions are encrypted and authenticated. Implement automated alerts for any anomalies detected during communication sessions.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Employees must document any incidents of communication failure or security breaches in the incident management system. Additionally, personnel must complete a **communication security training** and provide a signed acknowledgment of understanding the procedures.

## Verification Criteria

Compliance with this policy will be measured using specific **KPIs/SLAs** such as:
- Percentage of sessions that are encrypted (target: 100%).
- Frequency of security incidents related to communications (target: less than 1 incident per quarter).
- Timeliness of incident reporting (target: within 1 hour of detection).

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy may be granted in specific circumstances, such as technical limitations or business requirements. All exceptions must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. A formal request must be submitted detailing the reason for the exception and the proposed alternative measures to maintain security.

## Lifecycle Requirements

All evidence and logs must adhere to a **Data Retention** period of **two years**. The policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance, incorporating any necessary adjustments based on technological advancements or regulatory changes.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through formal documentation. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for all critical actions related to communications security. Any exceptions granted must also be documented and reviewed during the **Annual Review** process.
