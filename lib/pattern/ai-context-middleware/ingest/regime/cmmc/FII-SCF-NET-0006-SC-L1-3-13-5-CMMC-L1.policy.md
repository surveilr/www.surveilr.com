# Network Segmentation Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for implementing effective network segmentation within the organization. Network segmentation is critical in protecting systems, applications, and services by isolating them from other network resources. This isolation minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the organization.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to implementing robust network segmentation practices to ensure the protection of sensitive systems, applications, and services. Network segments will be designed to limit access based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring that only authorized personnel can interact with specific network resources.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational assets, including but not limited to:
- On-premises networks
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors accessing these systems must adhere to this policy.

## Responsibilities
- **Network Administrators**: Configure and maintain network segmentation controls **monthly**.
- **Security Officers**: Conduct network segmentation audits and assessments **quarterly**.
- **Compliance Team**: Review and report on network segmentation compliance **bi-annually**.
- **IT Staff**: Implement corrective actions for segmentation violations **within 48 hours** of detection.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**:
   - Collect configuration files and network diagrams to demonstrate existing segmentation.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**:
   - Utilize OSquery to verify network segmentation configurations and generate reports that confirm compliance with segmentation requirements.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**:
   - Require personnel to complete a compliance checklist; responses will be ingested into Surveilr for validation.

## Verification Criteria
To validate compliance with this policy, the following **SMART** criteria will be used:
- **Network segmentation must be implemented across all critical systems** with a target compliance rate of **100%** by the end of each fiscal year.
- **Audit findings** must reflect no more than **5% deviations** from the established segmentation standards during quarterly assessments.
- **Remediation of segmentation violations** must be completed within **48 hours** of identification.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Security Officer. A formal exception request must include:
- Justification for the exception
- Duration of the exception
- Any compensatory controls that will be in place during the exception period

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence of compliance, including logs and attestations, must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All personnel must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to network segmentation. Formal documentation must be created for all exceptions, detailing the rationale and approval process.
