## Introduction
In todayâ€™s digital landscape, the management of privileged accounts is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of organizational resources. Privileged accounts have elevated access rights that, if mismanaged, can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security incidents. Therefore, it is essential to restrict the assignment of these accounts to only those personnel who have been formally approved by management. This policy outlines the necessary measures to ensure compliance with Control AC.L2-3.1.5.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to restricting the assignment of privileged accounts solely to management-approved personnel and/or roles. This policy aims to protect sensitive data and systems by ensuring that only qualified individuals have access to elevated privileges, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- On-premises systems
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems

All personnel involved in the management, assignment, and oversight of privileged accounts are required to adhere to this policy.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Review and approve privileged account requests **monthly**.
- **Managers**: Submit privileged account requests for personnel **as needed**.
- **Compliance Officer**: Conduct audits of privileged account assignments **quarterly**.
- **Systems Administrators**: Implement access restrictions for privileged accounts **immediately upon approval**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Restrict the assignment of privileged accounts to management-approved personnel and/or roles.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
   - Integrate with identity management systems using API calls to automate the collection of evidence confirming that privileged accounts are assigned only to approved personnel. This includes extracting user role assignments and comparing them against a management-approved list.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
   - Managers must sign a quarterly report detailing current privileged account assignments. This report will be uploaded to **Surveilr** for documentation purposes. Managers are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of this report.

## Verification Criteria

  - Automated reports from identity management systems indicating the number of privileged accounts assigned to approved roles.
  - Signed quarterly reports from managers, demonstrating adherence to the approval process.
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) may include:
  - 100% of privileged account assignments approved by management.
  - 0 unauthorized privileged account assignments reported.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. The process for documenting exceptions includes:
- Submission of an exception request form detailing the rationale for the exception.
- Approval from the relevant department head and the Compliance Officer.
- Recording the exception in the Surveilr system for audit purposes.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Evidence must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- This policy must be reviewed and updated **at least annually** to remain compliant with changing regulations and organizational needs.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through an electronic attestation process.

- Formal documentation of all exceptions must be stored in a secure repository accessible for audit purposes.
