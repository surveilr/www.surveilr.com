# Cryptographic Mechanisms Policy for Control: SC.L2-3.13.8

## Introduction
This policy establishes the requirements for utilizing cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information as an alternative to physical safeguards, aligned with CMMC control SC.L2-3.13.8. The intent is to ensure that all sensitive data is adequately protected using cryptographic methods that are both auditable and compliant with regulatory standards.

## Policy Statement
The organization shall implement cryptographic mechanisms to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access and disclosure. All cryptographic solutions must be regularly evaluated for effectiveness and compliance with established security protocols.

## Scope
This policy applies to all workforce members, contractors, and third-party service providers who handle sensitive information within the organization. It encompasses all data at rest and in transit that requires protection through cryptographic measures.

## Responsibilities
1. **IT Security Team**:
   - **Action Verb + Frequency**: Implement, monitor, and review cryptographic mechanisms **monthly**.
   - Ensure compliance with this policy and report any anomalies to the compliance officer.

2. **Compliance Officer**:
   - **Action Verb + Frequency**: Review cryptographic practices **quarterly** and provide a detailed report to management.
   - Lead the annual review and update of this policy.

3. **Workforce Members**:
   - **Action Verb + Frequency**: Acknowledge understanding of this policy upon employment and **annually** thereafter.
   - Report any potential breaches of sensitive information immediately.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Cryptographic mechanisms must be in place to protect sensitive information.
   
   **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
   - Utilize tools such as OpenSSL to check the encryption status of sensitive files bi-weekly.
   - Implement OSquery to monitor cryptographic configurations and generate reports automatically every **14 days**.

   **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
   - The IT Security Team must document and review cryptographic practices in a report signed off by the Compliance Officer **monthly**.

2. **REQUIREMENT**: Regular audits of cryptographic mechanisms.
   
   **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
   - Schedule automated vulnerability scans using Nessus or similar tools **weekly** to identify weaknesses in cryptographic configurations.

   **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
   - The Compliance Officer must conduct a manual review of audit logs and sign off on findings **quarterly**.

## Verification Criteria
Success in meeting this policy's requirements will be measured against the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- **100%** compliance with cryptographic mechanisms as audited bi-annually.
- **Zero** unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information as a result of cryptographic failures.
- **100%** workforce member acknowledgment of this policy within **30 days** of employment and **annually** thereafter.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions will only be granted if an acceptable alternative control is implemented that meets or exceeds the protections outlined in this policy.

## Lifecycle Requirements
All cryptographic mechanisms must be evaluated and updated at least **annually** to ensure they are in line with current best practices and regulatory standards. Additionally, log data must be retained for a minimum of **one year** to support audits and compliance checks.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All actions taken under this policy must be documented in formal reports, which will be stored securely for a minimum of **one year**. Comprehensive audit logging must be enabled for all critical actions related to cryptographic mechanisms, which will be reviewed during scheduled audits.
