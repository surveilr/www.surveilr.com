## Introduction

This policy establishes guidelines for monitoring and controlling communications at the external network boundary and key internal boundaries within the network. It aims to ensure that all communications are secure, monitored, and compliant with organizational standards and regulatory requirements. Effective monitoring and control mechanisms are critical for protecting sensitive information and maintaining the integrity of our network.

## Policy Statement

The organization shall implement robust monitoring and control measures at all external network boundaries and key internal boundaries to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. These measures will involve both machine and human attestations to ensure compliance with established security protocols.

## Scope

This policy applies to all systems and personnel involved in the management of network communications, including but not limited to:

- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit data

All organizational units, including IT, security, and compliance teams, are included in this scope.

## Responsibilities

- **Network Security Team: Monitor daily network traffic** to identify anomalies and ensure compliance with security policies.
- **IT Operations: Conduct quarterly reviews** of network control measures and update configurations as necessary.
- **Compliance Officer: Facilitate **annual reviews** of the policy and ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.

These responsibilities align with the organizational escalation and recovery plans to address any incidents or vulnerabilities discovered during monitoring activities.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT:** Continuous monitoring of network communications.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Use Surveilr to automate the logging of all inbound and outbound traffic to generate daily reports.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Network security personnel will review and sign off on the daily logs weekly.

2. **REQUIREMENT:** Control of access to network boundaries.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Implement firewall rules using automated scripts that log changes to access controls.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** The network administrator will conduct monthly access reviews and document findings.

3. **REQUIREMENT:** Incident response for detected anomalies.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Utilize intrusion detection systems (IDS) that automatically alert the security team upon detecting suspicious activity.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** The incident response team shall prepare a report within 48 hours of an incident and submit it for management review.

## Verification Criteria

Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:

- **Daily monitoring logs** must be reviewed and signed off by network security personnel at least 5 days a week.
- **Monthly access reviews** must be completed and documented, with a completion rate of 100% within the first week of each month.
- **Incident reports** must be generated and reviewed within 48 hours of detection, ensuring all incidents are addressed promptly.

## Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and approved by the compliance officer. Requests for exceptions must include justifications and an assessment of risks involved.

## Lifecycle Requirements

- **Data Retention:** All logs and evidence must be retained for a minimum of **3 years** to comply with regulatory requirements.
- **Annual Review:** This policy will undergo an **annual review** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness, incorporating any necessary updates based on emerging threats or changes in technology.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding of this policy and attest to their compliance. Comprehensive audit logging will be required for all critical actions, including access changes, incident responses, and policy reviews.
