You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "CA.L2-3.12.1" (FII: "FII-SCF-IAO-0002"). 

**Policy Structure**: 

1. **Introduction**: Introduce the purpose and importance of the policy regarding the assessment of cybersecurity and data privacy controls.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organizationâ€™s commitment to formally assessing the cybersecurity and data privacy controls within its systems, applications, and services through Information Assurance Program (IAP) activities.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope of the policy, covering all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role involved in the policy, such as Compliance Officer, IT Security, and other relevant personnel.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Detail the requirement for formal assessments of controls.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using OSquery to collect system data and validate configuration settings.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Outline precise steps, such as having a manager sign off on assessment reports, and specify how these artifacts will be documented and ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Define any exceptions to the policy along with the approval process and documentation required.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update** (e.g., reviewed at least **annually**).

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, and establish comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

10. **References**: Conclude the policy document with a single **References** section listing relevant external resources using the format [Link Text](URL). Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

**Important Instructions**: 
- Use H2 headings (##) for each major requirement.
- Include attestation guidance in each section, emphasizing machine attestability.
- Ensure that all statements are **SMART**, with specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound instructions.
- **Bold** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** where applicable.
- Do NOT include any SQL queries, code blocks, or references subsections within individual sections of the policy.

End the policy document with exactly ONE **References** section.
