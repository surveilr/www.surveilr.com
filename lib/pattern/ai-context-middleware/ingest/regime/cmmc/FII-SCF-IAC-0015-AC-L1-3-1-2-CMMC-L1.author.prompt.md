You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L1-3.1.2 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0015). 

The policy document must follow this structure without including References subsections within individual sections, and it must end with exactly ONE References section. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the purpose and importance of account management governance within the organization.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to proactive account management for individual, group, system, service, application, guest, and temporary accounts.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, explicitly including all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Outline specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in account management, such as the Compliance Officer, IT Security, and System Administrators.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. **REQUIREMENT**: Describe the specific account management requirements.
   - 2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Use API integrations to validate access controls").
   - 3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly account review report").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** instructions and **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the previous section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification, duration, and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., "retain for 6 years") and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., "reviewed at least **annually**").

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document, formatted as [Link Text](URL) for any external references.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by including attestation guidance in every section. Each section must be detailed, specific, and adhere to the requirements outlined above. Remember, do not include References subsections within individual policy sections.
