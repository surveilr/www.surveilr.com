You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "SC.L2-3.13.11" (FII: "FII-SCF-CRY-0001"). 

The policy must follow this structure without including References subsections within individual sections and must end with exactly ONE References section. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the purpose of the policy regarding cryptographic protections.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to implementing cryptographic protections using known public standards and trusted cryptographic technologies.

3. **Scope**: Define the comprehensive scope of the policy, including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data.

4. **Responsibilities**: List specific, task-level duties for each role involved (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review) using **Action Verb + Frequency** format, and explicitly link to related organizational plans.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Explain the control requirement related to cryptographic protections.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using OSquery to validate configurations.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Describe the specific actions and artifacts required for human validation, including how they will be documented and ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **SMART** goals and **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the previous section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification, duration, and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update, specifying that policies must be **reviewed at least annually**.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a single References section at the very end of the document, formatted with external references using [Link Text](URL) format, or state "None" if there are no external references.

Ensure that **BOLD** keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are explicitly used throughout the document. Do not include any SQL queries or code blocks. The policy must be structured to maximize machine attestability and provide attestation guidance for each requirement.
