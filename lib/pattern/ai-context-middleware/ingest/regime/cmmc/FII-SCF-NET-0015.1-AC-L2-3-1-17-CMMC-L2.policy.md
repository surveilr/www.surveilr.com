## Wireless Access Security Policy

### Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the protection of wireless access within the organization. This includes implementing strong authentication measures and encryption protocols to safeguard sensitive information, particularly electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), from unauthorized access and breaches.

### Policy Statement
The organization is committed to ensuring the security of wireless access through robust authentication methods and strong encryption techniques. All wireless communications that involve the transmission of ePHI must adhere to the highest standards of security to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and data breaches.

### Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access or manage wireless systems within the organization. It encompasses all environments including cloud-hosted systems, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, and systems used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. 

### Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Conduct **quarterly assessments** of wireless networks to ensure compliance with security standards.
- **Network Administrators**: Implement and maintain encryption protocols for wireless access **monthly**.
- **Compliance Officer**: Review wireless access policies and procedures **annually** for effectiveness and compliance with relevant regulations.
- **All Employees**: Complete mandatory wireless access training **biannually**.

### Evidence Collection Methods

#### 1. REQUIREMENT
The organization must protect wireless access through robust authentication mechanisms and strong encryption. This includes ensuring that all wireless networks meet industry standards for security.

#### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION
To verify compliance with the control requirements, the organization will utilize automated methods such as:
- **OSquery**: Regularly collect wireless configuration data to ensure compliance with encryption standards.
- **API Integrations**: Automatically validate encryption protocols in use across all wireless access points.

#### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION
Human attestation will involve:
- **Manager Sign-offs**: Managers must review and sign off on wireless access security reports **monthly**. 
- **Documentation Submission**: Signed reports must be ingested into Surveilr for compliance tracking.

### Verification Criteria
The organization will establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation based on:
- **KPIs/SLAs** for incident response time related to wireless access breaches.
- The percentage of wireless access points meeting encryption standards, aiming for **100% compliance**.

### Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and justified by the requesting party. Approval must be obtained from the Compliance Officer. Exceptions will be reviewed **quarterly** to assess their continued validity.

### Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Logs and evidence related to wireless access security must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo a comprehensive review **annually** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

### Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through formal documentation. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to wireless access. Any documented exceptions will also be formally recorded and reviewed.
