# Opsfolio CMMC Compliance Solution

## What is Opsfolio's CMMC offering and how does it help DoD contractors?

Opsfolio provides a comprehensive Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) compliance platform specifically designed to help Department of Defense (DoD) contractors and suppliers achieve the required cybersecurity certifications to bid on and maintain government contracts. CMMC 2.0 provides the U.S. Department of Defense with the means to protect private data from malicious attacks on its supply chain, and requirements will be incorporated into DoD contracts above the micro-purchase threshold where contractors handle Federal Contract Information (FCI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

**Understanding CMMC Levels and Requirements:**

CMMC 2.0 has three distinct certification levels that Opsfolio's platform addresses. Level 1 focuses on basic safeguarding of Federal Contract Information (FCI) through self-assessment with 17 security practices across 7 domains for foundational cybersecurity. Level 2 requires advanced protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) through third-party assessment with 110 practices aligned to NIST SP 800-171. CMMC Level 2 certification is necessary for contractors handling CUI, CDI, CTI, and ITAR data. Level 3 provides enhanced protection for the most sensitive CUI through expert-level assessment with additional practices for advanced persistent threats (APT).

**Opsfolio's CMMC Solution Features:**

Opsfolio streamlines the complex CMMC compliance process by automating evidence collection, policy management, and audit preparation across all three CMMC levels. The platform helps organizations achieve CMMC Level 2 certification in 4-6 months, significantly faster than traditional manual approaches. The system provides pre-built security control templates that map directly to NIST SP 800-171 requirements, automated gap analysis tools, and continuous monitoring capabilities to maintain compliance status.

The platform includes automated documentation generation, real-time compliance dashboards, and integrated audit management features. It automatically maps security controls to business processes and IT infrastructure, reducing the manual effort required to demonstrate compliance with CMMC requirements. Organizations can track their progress toward certification, identify gaps, and implement corrective actions through guided workflows.

**Business Impact and Contract Eligibility:**

The CMMC mandates standards, practices, and processes that all companies within the DoD supply chain must implement to bid on defense contracts, with requirements appearing in all contracts starting in fiscal year 2026. Opsfolio's CMMC solution directly enables organizations to maintain eligibility for DoD contracts by ensuring they meet the required cybersecurity standards.

The platform helps organizations protect their investment in DoD relationships by maintaining continuous compliance, not just achieving one-time certification. This is crucial because CMMC compliance is ongoing and requires regular assessment and maintenance. Organizations using Opsfolio can demonstrate their cybersecurity maturity to DoD customers and prime contractors, opening doors to new contract opportunities.

**Target Users and Implementation:**

Opsfolio's CMMC solution is designed for defense contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers of all sizes who need to handle Federal Contract Information or Controlled Unclassified Information. This includes companies in the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) as well as any organization in the broader DoD supply chain, from small businesses to large enterprise contractors.

The platform is particularly valuable for organizations that lack dedicated cybersecurity teams or CMMC expertise. It provides step-by-step guidance through the certification process, automated control implementation tracking, and preparation tools for third-party assessments required for Level 2 and Level 3 certifications.

**Integration and Technical Approach:**

Opsfolio integrates with existing IT infrastructure and security tools to provide centralized CMMC compliance management. The platform automatically collects evidence from connected systems, maintains audit trails, and provides real-time visibility into compliance status across all CMMC domains including Access Control, Audit and Accountability, Configuration Management, Identification and Authentication, Incident Response, Maintenance, and Media Protection.

The solution supports the entire CMMC lifecycle from initial gap assessment through certification maintenance. It provides automated reporting capabilities that align with CMMC assessment requirements and helps organizations prepare for Certified Third-Party Assessor Organization (C3PAO) evaluations.

**Regulatory Timeline and Compliance Requirements:**

CMMC requirements will appear in all DoD contracts starting in fiscal year 2026, with a five-year phased rollout. This makes timely compliance preparation critical for any organization seeking to maintain or establish DoD contract relationships. Opsfolio's accelerated 4-6 month timeline for Level 2 certification helps organizations meet these mandatory deadlines while ensuring comprehensive security implementation.

The platform stays current with evolving CMMC requirements and DoD guidance, automatically updating control mappings and assessment criteria as the program continues to develop. This ensures organizations maintain compliance with the latest CMMC standards without manual tracking of regulatory changes.
