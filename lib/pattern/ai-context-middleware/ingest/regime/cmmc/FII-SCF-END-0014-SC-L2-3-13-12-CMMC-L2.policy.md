# Policy for Control: SC.L2-3.13.12 (FII: FII-SCF-END-0014)

## Introduction
The intent of this policy is to establish a clear directive regarding the prohibition of remote activation of collaborative computing devices within the organization. This policy aims to enhance security measures, protect sensitive information, and ensure compliance with CMMC requirements. By prohibiting unauthorized remote activations, we aim to mitigate potential risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access.

## Policy Statement
The organization prohibits the remote activation of collaborative computing devices, including but not limited to networked whiteboards, video teleconference cameras, and teleconference microphones. Exceptions to this prohibition may be permitted under specific, documented circumstances that align with operational needs, subject to prior approval from designated authorities.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, third-party vendors, and affiliated entities who utilize collaborative computing devices in any organizational environment. This includes on-premises systems, cloud-hosted platforms, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, and third-party vendor systems. All device types within these environments are covered by this policy.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - **Monitor** compliance with the policy **Monthly**.
  - **Review** and assess exception requests **As Received**.
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - **Conduct** annual policy reviews **Annually**.
  - **Document** any exceptions and maintain records **As Required**.
- **Employees**: 
  - **Adhere** to this policy and report any violations **Continuously**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization mandates that all collaborative computing devices cannot be remotely activated without explicit authorization.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automated logging systems must be deployed to monitor and record device usage and access attempts. Tools should be configured to generate regular compliance reports indicating adherence to the policy.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Employees must submit a signed acknowledgment of understanding the policy. Regular training sessions should be conducted to reinforce compliance expectations and gather feedback on policy effectiveness.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through measurable criteria, including:
- **100%** of collaborative computing devices must demonstrate compliance with the remote activation prohibition as recorded in automated logs.
- **Annual Review Completion Rate** must meet or exceed **95%** of scheduled assessments.
- **Exception Documentation** must be completed for all approved exceptions, with a target of **100%** compliance.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be made for specific operational requirements involving networked whiteboards, video teleconference cameras, and teleconference microphones. The process for requesting an exception includes:
1. Submitting a formal request to the Compliance Officer.
2. Providing justification and supporting documentation.
3. Awaiting written approval before implementing any remote activation.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs related to remote activation must be retained for a minimum of **3 years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy must undergo a comprehensive review process at least **once a year** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through signed documentation. Critical actions related to collaborative computing devices must be logged for audit purposes. Any exceptions granted must be formally documented, including the rationale and approval details, to ensure transparency and accountability.
