# Mobile Device Management Access Control Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for enforcing access control requirements for the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems. Given the increasing reliance on mobile devices for handling sensitive data, particularly electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), it is critical to implement robust access controls to safeguard organizational assets and maintain compliance with regulatory standards.

## Policy Statement
The organization commits to enforcing stringent access control requirements for mobile devices that connect to organizational systems. This commitment ensures that only authorized devices can access sensitive data, thereby mitigating security risks and upholding compliance with industry regulations.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer:** 
  - **Quarterly policy approval.**
  - Ensure compliance with relevant regulations.
- **IT Security:**
  - **Daily log review** of mobile device access.
  - Monitor compliance with access control measures.
- **Mobile Device Management Team:**
  - **Monthly inventory audits** of mobile devices.
  - Ensure devices meet compliance standards before granting access.
  
All roles must adhere to the organizational escalation and recovery plans as outlined in related documentation.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:** The organization must ensure that only authorized mobile devices can access organizational systems.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Utilize OSquery to collect mobile device compliance data **daily** to ensure that devices meet access control criteria.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** The IT manager must sign off on the **quarterly mobile device inventory report**, which is ingested into Surveilr for compliance tracking.

## Verification Criteria
- Compliance will be validated through the following **SMART** criteria:
  - **Specific:** All mobile devices must have an active compliance status.
  - **Measurable:** Achieve a compliance rate of 95% or higher for all mobile devices.
  - **Actionable:** Conduct audits and reviews as specified.
  - **Relevant:** Ensure access controls are relevant to organizational risk assessments.
  - **Time-bound:** Review compliance metrics **monthly**.
  
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) will be established to monitor compliance effectiveness.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. The documentation process includes:
- Submission of a formal exception request.
- Review of the request by the IT Security team.
- Approval or denial documented in Surveilr.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** All evidence and logs must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- **Annual Review:** This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure ongoing relevance and compliance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy upon initial training and **annually thereafter**.
- Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for critical actions, including access requests and device compliance checks.
- All exceptions must be formally documented and reviewed during the annual policy audit.
