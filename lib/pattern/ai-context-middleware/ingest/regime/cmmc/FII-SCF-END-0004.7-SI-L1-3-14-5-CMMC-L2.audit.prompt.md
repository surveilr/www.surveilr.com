You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization ensures that anti-malware technologies are continuously running in real-time and cannot be disabled or altered by non-privileged users, unless specifically authorized by management on a case-by-case basis for a limited time period."
  * **Control Code:** SI.L1-3.14.5
  * **Control Question:** Does the organization ensure that anti-malware technologies are continuously running in real-time and cannot be disabled or altered by non-privileged users, unless specifically authorized by management on a case-by-case basis for a limited time period?
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-END-0004.7
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):** "This policy establishes the framework for ensuring that anti-malware technologies are continuously operational in real-time across the organization. The intent is to protect organizational information and systems from malware threats by ensuring that anti-malware solutions are not disabled or altered by unauthorized users. The organization is committed to maintaining the integrity and efficacy of its anti-malware technologies. These systems must operate continuously in real-time and cannot be disabled or modified by non-privileged users without explicit authorization from management, limited to specific cases and timeframes."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "OSquery results indicating all endpoints have active anti-malware services running continuously. Monthly signed report from the IT manager confirming that no unauthorized access occurred to alter anti-malware settings."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - SI.L1-3.14.5

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** SI.L1-3.14.5
**Control Question:** Does the organization ensure that anti-malware technologies are continuously running in real-time and cannot be disabled or altered by non-privileged users, unless specifically authorized by management on a case-by-case basis for a limited time period?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-END-0004.7
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization ensures that anti-malware technologies are continuously running in real-time and cannot be disabled or altered by non-privileged users, unless specifically authorized by management on a case-by-case basis for a limited time period.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Anti-malware technologies must operate continuously and in real-time without unauthorized alterations.
    * **Provided Evidence:** OSquery results indicating that all endpoints have active anti-malware services running continuously.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery for endpoint data.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM anti_malware WHERE status = 'active';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided evidence from OSquery confirms that all endpoints have active anti-malware services running as required by the control.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Monthly reports from IT managers should indicate no unauthorized access to anti-malware settings.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Monthly signed report from the IT manager confirming that no unauthorized access occurred to alter anti-malware settings.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** The IT manager's manual review and certification of access restrictions.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The signed report is recorded in Surveilr's evidence repository.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed report from the IT manager confirms compliance with the policy, indicating that all access to alter anti-malware settings has been controlled and authorized appropriately.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The active monitoring of anti-malware services via OSquery and the monthly attestation from the IT manager collectively confirm that the organization is effectively protecting its systems against unauthorized alterations.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None identified; all evidence aligns with the control's intent.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit findings indicate full compliance with the control requirements, as evidenced by the continuous operation of anti-malware technologies and the proper management of access controls.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL") 

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:** N/A
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:** N/A
* **Required Human Action Steps:** N/A
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** N/A
