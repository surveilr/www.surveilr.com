# Policy for Secure Management of Authenticators

## Introduction
In today's digital landscape, securely managing authenticators for users and devices is paramount to safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. This policy aims to outline the principles and practices necessary to protect the integrity of authentication mechanisms, thereby preventing unauthorized access and potential breaches of sensitive data, including electronic protected health information (ePHI).

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to securely managing authenticators for all users and devices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. This policy establishes specific controls and objectives to enforce consistent practices in the creation, maintenance, and revocation of authenticators, thereby mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors involved in the management of authenticators across all systems, including but not limited to:

- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels involved in the creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of ePHI

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Conduct quarterly audits on authenticator management processes and report findings to management.
- **System Administrators**: Implement and monitor authenticator security controls on a **Weekly** basis, ensuring compliance with established policies.
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and update the authenticator management policy during the **Annual Review**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must ensure that authenticators are managed securely according to specified controls.

- Ensuring that no unauthorized access incidents occur related to authenticator mismanagement (SLA).
- Maintaining a minimum of 95% employee completion rate for authenticator security training (KPI).

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and submitted for approval to the Compliance Officer. Approved exceptions will be reviewed during the **Annual Review** to assess their continued relevance and risk.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Minimum **Data Retention** period for authenticator logs and evidence must be set at three years.
- The policy will undergo a mandatory **Annual Review** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance in the face of evolving threats and technologies.
