You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization shall host all security-specific technologies within a dedicated subnet to ensure enhanced security and compliance with CMMC requirements."
Control Code: SC.L2-3.13.2,
Control Question: Does the organization host security-specific technologies in a dedicated subnet?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-CLD-0003
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy outlines the requirements for hosting security-specific technologies in a dedicated subnet, as mandated by CMMC Control SC.L2-3.13.2. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all security-related systems are isolated to enhance security posture and mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access to sensitive data."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Network monitoring tools verify that all security technologies are deployed within the designated subnet. Monthly subnet configuration reports signed by the IT Security Manager are uploaded to Surveilr within 5 business days of the end of each month. Automated alerts for unauthorized devices are configured and operational. Logs of unauthorized access attempts are maintained and reviewed within 24 hours."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - SC.L2-3.13.2

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** SC.L2-3.13.2
**Control Question:** Does the organization host security-specific technologies in a dedicated subnet?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-CLD-0003
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization shall host all security-specific technologies within a dedicated subnet to ensure enhanced security and compliance with CMMC requirements.

## 1. Executive Summary

The audit findings indicate that the organization successfully hosts all security-specific technologies within a dedicated subnet, as required by CMMC Control SC.L2-3.13.2. Evidence provided demonstrates compliance with both machine and human attestation methods. The monthly subnet configuration reports are signed and uploaded in a timely manner, and unauthorized access attempts are logged and reviewed as per policy requirements.

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Host security-specific technologies in a dedicated subnet.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Network monitoring tools verify that all security technologies are deployed within the designated subnet.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion from network monitoring tools.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM network_config WHERE subnet = 'dedicated_subnet'; 
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence provided confirms that all security technologies are indeed hosted in the dedicated subnet, as verified by the network monitoring tools.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Monthly reports must be signed and uploaded to Surveilr within 5 business days.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Monthly subnet configuration reports signed by the IT Security Manager are uploaded to Surveilr.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Document upload process in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed reports are consistently uploaded within the required timeframe, demonstrating adherence to the policy.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** IT Security Manager must sign the monthly subnet configuration report.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed reports are uploaded to Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Monthly review and signing of subnet configuration reports.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Surveilr records the upload of signed documents.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence of signed reports confirms that the IT Security Manager is fulfilling their attestation responsibilities.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the organization meets the underlying purpose and intent of the control.
* **Justification:** The isolation of security-specific technologies within a dedicated subnet effectively enhances security posture and mitigates risks, aligning with the control's intent.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The organization has successfully demonstrated compliance with the control requirements through both machine and human attestation methods. All evidence aligns with the control's intent, and no gaps were identified.
