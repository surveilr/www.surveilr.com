You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: IA.L2-3.5.5 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0009).

## Policy Document Structure

1. **Introduction**
   - Describe the purpose of the policy regarding the governance of naming standards for usernames and systems.

2. **Policy Statement**
   - Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to maintaining naming standards and their importance for security and compliance.

3. **Scope**
   - Define the scope of the policy to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**
   - Specify task-level duties with **Action Verbs + Frequency** for each role involved (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily username compliance checks).

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Outline the specific requirement for governing naming standards.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical, automatable methods to verify compliance (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect and validate username formats against the established naming standards").
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Describe the precise action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly review of username compliance, with the signed report uploaded to Surveilr").

6. **Verification Criteria**
   - Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs** (e.g., "Compliance checks must confirm 100% adherence to naming standards, validated quarterly").

7. **Exceptions**
   - Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification, duration, and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**
   - Specify **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., "retain for 6 years") and the **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update** (e.g., "reviewed at least annually").

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**
   - Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance. Include comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**
    - Include a single, final references section at the end of the document. Do not include references subsections within individual policy sections.

**Important Notes:**
- The policy must replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions.
- Ensure that all **enforced keywords** such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are explicitly used and **BOLD**.
- The document must end with exactly ONE References section, and no other metadata or identifiers should be included.
