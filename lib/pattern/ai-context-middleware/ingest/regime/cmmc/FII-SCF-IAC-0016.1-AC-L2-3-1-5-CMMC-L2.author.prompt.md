You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.5 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0016.1). 

## Instructions for Policy Authoring:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy MUST follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, and References**. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections; the References section should only be at the end of the document.

2. **Policy Sections**: Each section should include:
   - An explanation of the control requirement.
   - Suggested machine attestation methods.
   - Suggested human attestation methods where necessary.

3. **Markdown Elements**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. 

4. **Attestation Guidance**:
   - For **Machine Attestation**: Describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
   - For **Human Attestation**: Detail specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.

5. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions, including a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA) for processes.

6. **Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

7. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

8. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when automation is impractical.

9. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role in the Responsibilities section, linking to related organizational plans as necessary.

10. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

11. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

12. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

13. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined.

14. **Markdown Formatting**: Ensure standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

15. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

16. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text MUST explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

17. **References Section Format**: The **References section is the FINAL section** of the policy document. If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

Ensure to create a policy that maximizes machine attestability and meets all compliance requirements outlined.
