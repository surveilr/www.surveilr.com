You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure that the organization effectively audits the execution of privileged functions to prevent unauthorized access and ensure accountability."
Control Code: AC.L2-3.1.7,
Control Question: Does the organization audit the execution of privileged functions?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-IAC-0021.4
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The organization is committed to actively auditing the execution of all privileged functions across its systems to ensure compliance with established security practices and to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access or misuse of privileges. This policy supports our overarching goal of maintaining robust security and compliance with CMMC standards."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "[**Logs of privileged function executions, including user IDs, timestamps, actions performed, and systems affected, showing 100% audit log completeness; automated log collection configuration verified through scripts; manual review documentation submitted for instances where automation was impractical.**]"


**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AC.L2-3.1.7

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** AC.L2-3.1.7
**Control Question:** Does the organization audit the execution of privileged functions?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-IAC-0021.4
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To ensure that the organization effectively audits the execution of privileged functions to prevent unauthorized access and ensure accountability.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** 100% of privileged functions logged.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Logs of privileged function executions, including user IDs, timestamps, actions performed, and systems affected.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated log collection via Surveilr, confirming the presence of logs through automated scripts.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM logs WHERE action_type = 'privileged' AND log_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-07-28';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence provided demonstrates that all privileged functions were logged accurately and completely, fulfilling the requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Logging configuration verification.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated scripts executed confirming logging mechanisms are enabled and functioning correctly.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Configuration verification scripts running on all systems.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The automated verification scripts confirm that logging configurations are in place as required.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Manual review documentation for privileged function activities.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Completed attestation forms documenting the manual review of privileged functions.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Designated personnel manually reviewing and documenting privileged function activities.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Forms submitted to Surveilr for record-keeping.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The manual review documentation is thorough and meets the requirements for human attestation.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the organization is effectively auditing privileged functions as intended.
* **Justification:** The evidence collected aligns not only with the literal requirements but also supports the underlying intent of accountability and unauthorized access prevention.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit confirmed compliance with the control requirements through both machine and human evidence, supporting the overall intent of the policy.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:** [Not applicable as the result is PASS.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:** [Not applicable as the result is PASS.]
* **Required Human Action Steps:** [Not applicable as the result is PASS.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [Not applicable as the result is PASS.]
