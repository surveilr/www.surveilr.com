You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: MP.L2-3.8.9 (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0011.4). 

The policy must follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and relevance to Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to utilizing cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and/or modification of backup information.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit backup information.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, such as IT Security, Compliance Officer, and Backup Administrator.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement for using cryptographic mechanisms for backup information.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using automated tools to verify encryption status of backup files.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify actions a human must perform, such as a manager signing off on encryption verification reports.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions to the policy, including justification and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (**Annual Review**).

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: This section must be the final section of the policy document. 

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by including attestation guidance in every section. Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code for technical terms. Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections; they should only appear at the end of the document. 

Emphasize the importance of including **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** in the policy text, ensuring that these keywords are **BOLD**. 

Output the policy without any additional content or metadata after the References section.
