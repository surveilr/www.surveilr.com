**Introduction**  
This policy outlines the framework for managing authorized applications within the organization to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information systems. Effective application control is vital in mitigating risks associated with unauthorized applications, which can lead to security breaches and data loss. This policy establishes guidelines for allowlisting and denylisting applications to maintain a secure operational environment.

**Policy Statement**  
The organization mandates a comprehensive application control strategy that encompasses both **allowlisting** of approved applications and **denylisting** of unauthorized applications. All systems must only execute applications that have been explicitly allowed, while all others will be blocked to ensure compliance with security protocols.

**Scope**  
This policy applies to all organizational systems, including but not limited to on-premises environments, cloud-hosted systems, and third-party vendor systems. It encompasses all personnel, processes, and technologies involved in application management within the organization.

**Responsibilities**  
- **IT Security Team**: **Implement** application control measures **quarterly**.  
- **System Administrators**: **Review** application lists for accuracy and compliance **monthly**.  
- **Compliance Officers**: **Audit** application control practices and report findings **bi-annually**.  
- **Employees**: **Report** any unauthorized applications or anomalies **immediately**.

**Evidence Collection Methods**  
1. **REQUIREMENT:**  
   Automated logs from security tools must be generated and reviewed to verify compliance with application control policies.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**  
   Utilize automated scripts to generate reports on application execution and compare them against the allowlist and denylist.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**  
   Employees must document findings of unauthorized applications using standardized forms, which will be submitted to the IT Security Team for processing.

**Verification Criteria**  
Compliance will be validated through metrics tied to **SMART** goals. The organization will track the percentage of applications executing within the allowlist against a target minimum of 95% **KPIs/SLAs**. Non-compliance incidents will be monitored and reported monthly.

**Exceptions**  
Any exceptions to the policy must be formally documented and approved by the IT Security Team. A request for an exception should include justification and potential risks associated with the deviation from this policy.

**Lifecycle Requirements**  
All evidence related to application control must adhere to a **Data Retention** period of no less than three years. The policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

**Formal Documentation and Audit**  
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through signed documentation. A comprehensive audit log must be maintained for all critical actions related to application control practices to ensure accountability and traceability.
