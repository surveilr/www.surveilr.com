You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PE.L1-3.10.3 (FII: FII-SCF-PES-0006.3). 

The policy must follow the exact structure outlined below:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the policy's purpose and importance regarding unescorted access to facilities.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's position on restricting unescorted access to facilities.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, ensuring it covers all relevant entities, environments, and systems, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Assign specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for roles involved in access control and validation.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the control requirement regarding access restrictions.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automatable methods for collecting evidence (e.g., "Use API integrations to verify access authorizations").
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify verifiable actions a human must perform (e.g., "Security manager must maintain a signed access authorization log").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, detailing the process for approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document. Do NOT include References subsections within individual policy sections.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by providing specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (**SMART**) instructions, and emphasize the importance of including attestation methods for all requirements. 

The policy should use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. The keywords **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** must be bolded throughout the document.

The References section is the FINAL section of the policy document, and it must contain exactly ONE References section, listing any external references used in the format [Link Text](URL). If no external references exist, output "None". 

Do not output any control identifiers, metadata, or additional content after the References section.
