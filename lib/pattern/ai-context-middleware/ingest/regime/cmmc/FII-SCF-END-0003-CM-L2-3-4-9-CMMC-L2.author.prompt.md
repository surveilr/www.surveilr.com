You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "CM.L2-3.4.9" (FII: "FII-SCF-END-0003"). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure:** The policy **MUST** follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.**

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity:** The policy **MUST** replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like containment, correction, or **violation sanction**, include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** along with a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition:** Explicitly define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, including **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems**, and **all channels** used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation:** For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed):** Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing:** The Responsibilities section **MUST** define **specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency)** for each role mentioned, linking to related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan).

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements:** The policy **MUST** detail **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit:** The policy **MUST** require: **Workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, and **Comprehensive audit logging** for all critical actions.

9. **Prohibited Content:** Focus on describing methods; do not write or embed SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code. 

10. **Evidence Collection Methods:** Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

11. **Verification Criteria:** Clear measurable criteria for compliance validation must be directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

12. **Markdown Formatting:** Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

13. **Hyperlinks:** Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

14. **Single References Section:** The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end.

15. **Keyword Emphasis:** The policy text **MUST** explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

16. **Final Section Requirements:** The **References section is the FINAL section** of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else.

17. **References Section Format:** If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by "None".

The policy must maximize machine attestability, and each section must include attestation guidance. Failure to include attestation methods for a requirement results in an automatic non-compliance. Ensure that References subsections do not appear after each policy section, and end the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
