You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: CA.L2-3.12.1, CA.L2-3.12.3 (FII: FII-SCF-CPL-0002). 

The policy must follow this exact structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Each section should include the following:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the policy's intent and objectives.
3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, and link to related organizational plans.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings for each requirement:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Describe precise actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for approval.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that every policy section includes attestation guidance for both machine and human methods. The policy must maximize machine attestability, and all instructions must be **SMART** (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Time-bound). 

Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections; the References section must appear only at the end of the document. 

At the end of the policy document, include exactly ONE References section formatted as follows: 
### References
[List any external references using the format [Link Text](URL) or state "None" if there are no external references.] 

Ensure that the keywords **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are emphasized in bold throughout the policy.
