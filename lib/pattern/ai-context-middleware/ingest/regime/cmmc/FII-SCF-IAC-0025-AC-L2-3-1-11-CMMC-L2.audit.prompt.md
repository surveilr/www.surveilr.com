You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure that the organization uses automated mechanisms to log out users, both locally on the network and for remote sessions, at the end of the session or after an organization-defined period of inactivity."
  * **Control Code:** AC.L2-3.1.11
  * **Control Question:** "Does the organization use automated mechanisms to log out users, both locally on the network and for remote sessions, at the end of the session or after an organization-defined period of inactivity?"
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-IAC-0025
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to ensure compliance with the CMMC control AC.L2-3.1.11, which mandates the implementation of automated mechanisms to log out users after the completion of their sessions or after a predefined period of inactivity. This policy provides guidelines for the effective management of user sessions, ensuring security and compliance across all organizational environments. The organization shall utilize automated mechanisms to log out users at the end of their session or after a defined period of inactivity. This policy applies to all user accounts across on-premises, cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "OSquery results showing session activity logs collected daily, which include timestamps of user logins and logouts. Automated logout mechanisms are configured to log users out after 15 minutes of inactivity. IT manager signed quarterly review report of user logout compliance submitted to Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AC.L2-3.1.11

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** CMMC Auditor
**Control Code:** AC.L2-3.1.11
**Control Question:** Does the organization use automated mechanisms to log out users, both locally on the network and for remote sessions, at the end of the session or after an organization-defined period of inactivity?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-IAC-0025
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To ensure that the organization uses automated mechanisms to log out users, both locally on the network and for remote sessions, at the end of the session or after an organization-defined period of inactivity.

## 1. Executive Summary

The audit found that the organization successfully implements automated logout mechanisms for user sessions, as evidenced by the daily session activity logs collected through OSquery, which detail user logins and logouts. The IT manager’s quarterly review reports confirm compliance with the logout policy. As a result, the overall audit decision is a **PASS**.

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Automated logout mechanisms must log users out after 15 minutes of inactivity.
    * **Provided Evidence:** OSquery results showing timestamps of user logins and logouts, indicating users are logged out automatically after inactivity.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Evidence collected via OSquery for user session activity logs.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SQL query to verify logouts: `SELECT * FROM session_logs WHERE logout_time IS NOT NULL AND inactivity_duration >= 15 minutes;`
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence demonstrates that the automated mechanisms effectively log users out after 15 minutes of inactivity, thereby meeting the control’s requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly review report of user logout compliance.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed quarterly review report submitted to Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** IT manager's manual review and attestation of compliance with the logout policy.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The signed report is stored in Surveilr for compliance record.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed quarterly review report confirms the effectiveness of the automated logout mechanisms, satisfying the human attestation requirement.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided demonstrates that the organization not only meets the literal requirements of the control but also adheres to the intent of ensuring user security and preventing unauthorized access through timely session logouts.
* **Justification:** The automated logout mechanisms effectively fulfill the control's purpose, and the human attestation reinforces compliance integrity.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** N/A

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit confirms compliance with CMMC control AC.L2-3.1.11 through robust automated mechanisms and proper human oversight, effectively securing user sessions against unauthorized access.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")
