You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.7 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0021.4). 

### Instructions for Policy Authoring:

1. **Document Structure**: Create the policy with the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Ensure that no References subsections are included within individual policy sections, and end the document with exactly ONE References section.

2. **Policy Content**:
   - **Introduction**: Clearly explain the purpose and importance of auditing privileged functions.
   - **Policy Statement**: Define the organization's commitment to auditing privileged functions.
   - **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
   - **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in the auditing process.
   - **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
     - Use a numbered subheading structure: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:" for each requirement.
     - Provide practical, automatable methods for machine attestation, including detailed descriptions of how evidence will be collected and verified through Surveilr.
     - Specify human attestation methods only when automation is impractical, including precise actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr.
   - **Verification Criteria**: Outline clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.
   - **Exceptions**: Define how exceptions to the policy will be managed and documented.
   - **Lifecycle Requirements**: State the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update.
   - **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

3. **Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullet points, and **bold text** for emphasis. Ensure to include the terms **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** in bold as required.

4. **Final Section**: Conclude with a single **References** section that lists any external references used in the policy at the end of the document. If there are no external references, state "None".

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes detailed operational steps with **SMART** instructions, and clearly documents all attestation methods.
