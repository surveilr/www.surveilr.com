You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: CA.L2-3.12.4 (FII: FII-SCF-IAO-0003). 

The policy must be structured as follows:

## Introduction
- Provide a clear overview of the control requirement and its importance.

## Policy Statement
- Define the organization's stance on generating System Security & Privacy Plans (SSPPs) and maintaining architectural information.

## Scope
- Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit data.

## Responsibilities
- Clearly outline specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in the implementation of this policy.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement for generating SSPPs.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., automated ingestion of SSPP documents into Surveilr).
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr for human verification.

## Verification Criteria
- Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

## Exceptions
- Outline the process for handling exceptions to the policy, including documentation requirements.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Specify **Data Retention** periods for evidence and mandatory review frequency (e.g., **Annual Review**).

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

### References
- List all external references used to support the policy in the format [Link Text](URL). If no external references exist, state "None."

Ensure that the document adheres to the specified structure without including References subsections within individual policy sections, and that it concludes with exactly ONE References section.
