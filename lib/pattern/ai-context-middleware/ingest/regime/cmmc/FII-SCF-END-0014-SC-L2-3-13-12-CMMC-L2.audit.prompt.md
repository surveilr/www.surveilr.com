You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

- **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
- **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
    - **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
    - **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
    - **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
- **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
    - **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
    - **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
    - **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
- **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

- **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
- **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The intent of this policy is to establish a clear directive regarding the prohibition of remote activation of collaborative computing devices within the organization. This policy aims to enhance security measures, protect sensitive information, and ensure compliance with CMMC requirements. By prohibiting unauthorized remote activations, we aim to mitigate potential risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access."
    - **Control Code:** SC.L2-3.13.12
    - **Control Question:** Does the organization unplug or prohibit the remote activation of collaborative computing devices with the following exceptions: ▪ Networked whiteboards; ▪ Video teleconference cameras; and ▪ Teleconference microphones?
    - **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-END-0014
- **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The organization prohibits the remote activation of collaborative computing devices, including but not limited to networked whiteboards, video teleconference cameras, and teleconference microphones. Exceptions to this prohibition may be permitted under specific, documented circumstances that align with operational needs, subject to prior approval from designated authorities."
- **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Automated logging systems have been deployed to monitor and record device usage and access attempts, with generated compliance reports indicating adherence to the policy. Signed acknowledgment forms from employees confirm understanding of the policy. Regular training sessions have been conducted to reinforce compliance expectations."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - SC.L2-3.13.12

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** SC.L2-3.13.12
**Control Question:** Does the organization unplug or prohibit the remote activation of collaborative computing devices with the following exceptions: ▪ Networked whiteboards; ▪ Video teleconference cameras; and ▪ Teleconference microphones?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-END-0014
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The intent of this policy is to establish a clear directive regarding the prohibition of remote activation of collaborative computing devices within the organization. This policy aims to enhance security measures, protect sensitive information, and ensure compliance with CMMC requirements. By prohibiting unauthorized remote activations, we aim to mitigate potential risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The organization mandates that all collaborative computing devices cannot be remotely activated without explicit authorization.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated logging systems have been deployed to monitor and record device usage and access attempts.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Evidence collected via automated logging systems.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM device_logs WHERE activation_status = 'remote' AND timestamp >= '2025-01-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence demonstrates that the organization has implemented automated systems to monitor device usage and ensure compliance with the prohibition on remote activation.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Employees must submit a signed acknowledgment of understanding the policy.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed acknowledgment forms from employees confirm understanding of the policy.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Employees were required to acknowledge their understanding of the policy through signed documentation.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Surveilr recorded the submission of signed acknowledgment forms.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The presence of signed acknowledgment forms indicates that employees are aware of the policy, fulfilling the requirement for human attestation.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided aligns with the control's intention to prevent unauthorized remote activations while allowing for necessary exceptions.
* **Justification:** The combination of automated logging and signed employee acknowledgments demonstrate that the control's spirit is being upheld.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** No critical gaps identified.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit findings indicate that the organization has effectively implemented both machine and human attestations to comply with the control requirements, demonstrating adherence to the intent of the policy.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [For each missing piece of evidence identified in Section 2, state *exactly* what is needed.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [For each instance of non-compliant evidence identified in Section 2, clearly state *why* it is non-compliant and what *specific correction* is required.]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [List precise steps a human auditor or compliance officer needs to take.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [Outline the process for re-submission of the corrected/missing evidence for re-evaluation.]
