You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.5 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0016). 

The policy document must follow this structure:

## Introduction
- Provide an overview of the importance of restricting and controlling privileged access rights for users and services.

## Policy Statement
- Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to managing privileged access.

## Scope
- Define the scope explicitly to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned, such as Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT:
   - Explain the control requirement.

2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - Suggest machine attestation methods that are practical and automatable. For example, describe how to collect data via OSquery or validate access controls through API integrations.

3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - Suggest specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods for human attestation when automation is impractical. For instance, describe the process for a manager to sign off on access reviews and how this is documented.

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined in the previous sections.

## Exceptions
- Outline the conditions under which exceptions to the policy may be granted and the process for documenting these exceptions.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

### References
- List all external references using the format [Link Text](URL). If no external references exist, state "None".

**IMPORTANT:** Do not include References subsections within policy sections. The policy document must end with exactly ONE References section.
