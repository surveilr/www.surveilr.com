You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: PE.L1-3.10.1 (FII: FII-SCF-PES-0012). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Each section should be detailed as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the policy's purpose and importance in minimizing potential damage from physical and environmental hazards and unauthorized access.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on the physical and environmental security of system components.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities, environments, cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems involved in the management of physical and environmental security.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, including references to related organizational plans.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings:
     - 1. **REQUIREMENT**: Describe the control requirement.
     - 2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automatable methods for collecting evidence (e.g., "Use OSquery to verify that all system components are located in secure areas").
     - 3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define exact actions, artifacts, and methods for documenting human attestations (e.g., "A facility manager must sign a quarterly report confirming the security status of all system components").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** instructions and **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions to the policy, including justification and approval processes.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the **Annual Review** frequency for policy updates.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require acknowledgment of understanding and compliance from workforce members, comprehensive logging of critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) instructions, and follows the required structure. Emphasize that **References** subsections should NOT appear within individual policy sections but only in the final **References** section at the end of the document.
