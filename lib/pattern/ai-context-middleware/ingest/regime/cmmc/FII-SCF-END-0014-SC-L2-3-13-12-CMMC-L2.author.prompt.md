You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: SC.L2-3.13.12 (FII: FII-SCF-END-0014). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Ensure that no References subsections are included within individual policy sections and that the document ends with exactly ONE References section.

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's intent regarding the prohibition of remote activation of collaborative computing devices.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's stance on remote activation and outline any exceptions allowed.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope of the policy to include all relevant entities, environments, and devices, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role involved in policy enforcement and compliance.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings per requirement:
     1. **REQUIREMENT**: State the requirement regarding remote activation.
     2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
     3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Detail specific actions and artifacts for human verification.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation that ties directly to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the process for requesting and documenting exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for any exceptions.

10. **References**: At the end of the document, include a single References section formatted as: 
   - ### References
   - [Link Text](URL) (if applicable) or "None" if no external references exist.

Make sure to emphasize the importance of including **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** in the policy text, ensuring that all keywords are **BOLD**. The policy must maximize machine attestability, and every section must contain attestation guidance.
