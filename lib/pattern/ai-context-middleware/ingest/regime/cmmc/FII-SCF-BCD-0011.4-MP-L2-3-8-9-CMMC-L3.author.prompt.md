You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: MP.L2-3.8.9 (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0011.4). 

The policy must follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the importance of cryptographic mechanisms in protecting backup information.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to utilizing cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of backup information.
3. **Scope**: Define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit backup information.
4. **Responsibilities**: Specify task-level duties for each role involved, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format (e.g., IT Security: daily review of backup encryption status).
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement for cryptographic mechanisms.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest methods for automated evidence collection (e.g., "Use OSquery to verify encryption status of backup files").
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Outline specific actions and artifacts for human verification (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly backup encryption report").
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.
7. **Exceptions**: Detail any exceptions to the policy, including the process for approval and documentation.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., "retain for 6 years") and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., "reviewed at least **annually**").
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
10. **References**: Include a single **References** section at the end of the document, without any References subsections in individual policy sections.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (**SMART**) instructions throughout. All enforced keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** must be **BOLD**. 

The policy document must end with exactly ONE **References** section. Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections.
