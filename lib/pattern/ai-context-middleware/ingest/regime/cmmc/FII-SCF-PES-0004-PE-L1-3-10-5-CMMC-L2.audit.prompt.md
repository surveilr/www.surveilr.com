**[START OF GENERATED PROMPT MUST CONTENT]**

You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure that the organization identifies systems, equipment, and respective operating environments that require limited physical access so that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms, and facilities."
Control Code: PE.L1-3.10.5,
Control Question: Does the organization identify systems, equipment and respective operating environments that require limited physical access so that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms and facilities?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-PES-0004
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish clear guidelines for identifying systems, equipment, and respective operating environments that require limited physical access. This is critical to ensure appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented across all relevant facilities, including cloud-hosted systems, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, and third-party vendor systems. It is the policy of the organization to identify and classify all systems and equipment that necessitate restricted physical access. This classification will guide the implementation of appropriate physical access controls to safeguard sensitive data and systems, particularly electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Automated asset management tool report categorizing all systems and equipment by access levels dated 2025-07-20. Signed report by Facility Managers documenting assessments for restricted access submitted to Surveilr within the required timeframe."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - PE.L1-3.10.5

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** CMMC Auditor
**Control Code:** PE.L1-3.10.5
**Control Question:** Does the organization identify systems, equipment and respective operating environments that require limited physical access so that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms and facilities?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-PES-0004
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To ensure that the organization identifies systems, equipment, and respective operating environments that require limited physical access so that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms, and facilities.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Identify systems and equipment that require limited physical access.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated asset management tool report categorizing all systems and equipment by access levels dated 2025-07-20.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated asset management tools were utilized to generate the report.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM asset_management WHERE access_level = 'restricted' AND report_date = '2025-07-20';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided evidence meets the control requirement as it demonstrates that all identified systems and equipment are accounted for in the asset management report.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Documented assessments by Facility Managers confirming restricted access.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed report by Facility Managers documenting assessments for restricted access submitted to Surveilr within the required timeframe.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Facility Managersâ€™ signed reports are ingested into Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence is compliant as it includes signatures and dates from Facility Managers, confirming completion within the stipulated five-day period.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Confirmation of assessments conducted by Facility Managers.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed report by Facility Managers documenting assessments for restricted access.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Facility Managers must conduct assessments and document them in signed reports.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Surveilr records the signed reports as evidence of human attestation.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed reports confirm that the assessments were completed and submitted within the required timeframe.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the organization effectively identifies systems, equipment, and environments requiring limited physical access and has implemented appropriate controls.
* **Justification:** The audit findings align with the control's underlying intent, ensuring that all processes for identifying and assessing physical access needs are documented and managed appropriately.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit decision is based on the compliance of both machine and human attestations. All aspects of the control were adequately covered by the provided evidence, demonstrating adherence to the control's requirements and intent.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [For each missing piece of evidence identified in Section 2, state *exactly* what is needed. E.g., "Missing current firewall rule sets from production firewalls (FII-XYZ-001) for the quarter ending 2025-06-30."]
    * [Specify the required format/type for each missing piece: e.g., "Obtain OSquery results for network interface configurations on all servers tagged 'production_web'.", "Provide a signed PDF of the latest incident response plan approval."]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [For each instance of non-compliant evidence identified in Section 2, clearly state *why* it is non-compliant and what *specific correction* is required. E.g., "Provided access logs show unapproved access event on 2025-07-15 by UserID 123; requires an associated incident ticket (IR-2025-005) or justification."]
    * [Specify the action needed: e.g., "Remediate firewall rule CC6-0010-005 to correctly block traffic from IP range X.Y.Z.0/24.", "Provide evidence of user access review completion for Q2 2025 for all critical systems."]
