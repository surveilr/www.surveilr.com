# CMMC Policy Document for Control: AU.L2-3.3.5 (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0002.1)

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements for continuous monitoring of information systems to ensure the security and integrity of organizational data, particularly electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). The importance of this policy lies in its ability to facilitate real-time detection and response to security incidents, thereby enhancing the organization's overall situational awareness and compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Policy Statement
The organization will implement automated mechanisms to correlate both technical and non-technical information across the enterprise using Security Incident Event Management (SIEM) or similar tools. The intent of this policy is to ensure effective monitoring, logging, and analysis of security events and incidents to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities, including cloud-hosted systems, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, and third-party vendor systems that handle ePHI. It encompasses all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who interact with these systems.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - **Monitor** security events daily using SIEM tools to ensure timely detection of incidents.
  - **Analyze** security logs weekly to identify anomalies and trends.
  - **Report** incidents within 24 hours to the Incident Response Team.
  
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - **Review** policy compliance quarterly, aligning with **Annual Review** requirements.
  - **Facilitate** training sessions biannually for staff on security best practices.

- **All Employees**: 
  - **Report** potential security incidents immediately (within 1 hour) to the IT Security Team.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must employ automated mechanisms for continuous monitoring of security events and incidents.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Implement OSquery to collect evidence regarding security events and configure API integrations with SIEM tools to automate data ingestion into Surveilr.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Staff must maintain a log of reported incidents, detailing the incident type and response actions taken. These logs must be submitted monthly to the Compliance Officer for review and integration into Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be assessed through measurable **KPIs/SLAs** including:
- Timeliness of incident reporting (incidents reported within 24 hours of detection).
- Completeness of security log analysis (100% of logs analyzed weekly).
- Documentation of incidents and responses (100% of incidents logged and reviewed).

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. The process involves submitting a formal request detailing the reason for the exception and a proposed alternative approach. Exceptions must be reviewed and updated during the **Annual Review**.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Security logs and evidence must be retained for a minimum of 12 months to comply with regulatory standards.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness, with revisions made as necessary based on the review findings.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their compliance with this policy through digital signatures. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained, documenting all security incidents, responses, and exceptions to the policy. These logs should be reviewed quarterly to ensure adherence to policy requirements.
