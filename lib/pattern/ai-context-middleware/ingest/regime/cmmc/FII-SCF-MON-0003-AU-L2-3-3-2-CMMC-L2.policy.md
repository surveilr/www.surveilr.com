# CMMC Compliant Policy Document for Control: AU.L2-3.3.2 (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0003)

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements and commitments for configuring systems to produce comprehensive event logs as part of our continuous monitoring efforts. Effective event logging is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of our systems, as it allows for the detection of anomalies, supports forensic investigations, and ensures compliance with regulatory standards. By establishing a robust event logging framework, we enhance our capability to proactively manage risks associated with information security.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to configuring all relevant systems to produce event logs that contain sufficient information to identify and analyze security events. This includes capturing details such as the type, timing, source, outcome, and user identity associated with each event. 

## Scope
This policy applies to all entities and environments that interact with our information systems, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit data.

## Responsibilities
- **System Administrators:** Configure and maintain logging settings on all systems, ensuring logs capture required event details on a **daily basis**.
- **Security Team:** Monitor logs for anomalies and potential security incidents, conducting reviews on a **weekly basis**.
- **Compliance Officers:** Ensure policy adherence and perform compliance checks on a **quarterly basis**.
- **Managers:** Review event logs for completeness and accuracy, providing oversight on a **monthly basis**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:** Event logs must include sufficient information to establish the type of event, timestamp, location, source, outcome, and user identity.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Use centralized logging solutions to automatically collect logs. Implement automated tools to verify the completeness and accuracy of logs.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Managers must review and validate the logs monthly, documenting findings and uploading the review results to Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following criteria:
- Logs must capture all required event information as specified.
- Automated tools must confirm that logs are collected and stored correctly.
- Monthly log reviews must be documented and uploaded to Surveilr, ensuring accountability.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented in writing, including a justification for the exception. Approval from the Compliance Officer is required prior to implementation of any exceptions.

## Lifecycle Requirements
Logs must be retained for a minimum period of **12 months** to facilitate audits and investigations. This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure ongoing relevance and compliance with changing regulations and best practices.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding of this policy upon onboarding and during annual training sessions. Comprehensive audit logging must be maintained for all critical actions taken within the information systems to ensure accountability and traceability.
