# Mobile Code and Operating System-Independent Applications Policy
**Control: SC.L2-3.13.13**  
**FII: FII-SCF-END-0010**  

## Introduction
This policy outlines the organizationâ€™s commitment to managing mobile code and operating system-independent applications to ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations. As mobile code increasingly becomes a critical component of modern applications, it is essential to establish a framework for its secure use, particularly concerning the protection of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

## Policy Statement
The organization is dedicated to addressing mobile code and operating system-independent applications by implementing robust security controls that mitigate risks associated with their use. This policy ensures compliance with relevant standards and promotes a secure environment for all stakeholders.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to cloud-hosted systems, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels utilized to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. All personnel and systems interacting with mobile code are subject to this policy.

## Responsibilities
- **Security Team**: Conducts **Monthly** reviews of mobile code usage and risks.
- **IT Department**: Implements controls and monitors mobile code activities **Weekly**.
- **Compliance Officer**: Ensures adherence to policy and reports findings **Quarterly**.
- **All Employees**: Attend training sessions on mobile code security **Annually** and report any suspicious activities **Immediately**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The control requires monitoring and managing the use of mobile code to protect ePHI.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize OSquery to collect asset inventories **Daily** and monitor mobile code execution logs.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Employees must complete a mobile code security checklist and submit it to Surveilr **Monthly** for ingestion and review.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through specific, measurable criteria linked to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods. This includes:
- Successful collection of asset inventories and logs.
- Timeliness of checklist submissions by personnel.
- Reporting and remediation of identified risks within 24 hours.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented through a formal request that includes a justification for the exception. The request will be reviewed by the Compliance Officer and must be approved by the Security Team before implementation.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs related to mobile code management must be retained for a minimum of **3 years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance, with updates made as necessary.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members are required to acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to mobile code management, and formal documentation will be required for all exceptions to ensure accountability and traceability.
