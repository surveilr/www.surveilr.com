# Incident Response Training Policy

## Introduction
Training personnel in their incident response roles and responsibilities is critical to ensuring the organization can effectively manage and mitigate security incidents. Well-trained staff can respond swiftly to threats, minimize damage, and maintain the trust of stakeholders. Furthermore, consistent and relevant training fosters a culture of security awareness and preparedness, which is essential for protecting sensitive information and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to ensuring that all personnel involved in incident response are adequately trained in their roles and responsibilities. This training will be designed to equip employees with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively respond to incidents, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the organization.

## Scope
This policy applies to all personnel involved in incident response, including but not limited to Incident Response Team members, Compliance Officers, IT Security staff, and any other roles that may impact incident response activities. It covers all environments including cloud-hosted systems, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

## Responsibilities
- **Incident Response Team**: Conduct training sessions on incident response procedures **Quarterly**.
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and update training materials and ensure compliance with training requirements **Annually**.
- **IT Security**: Facilitate the delivery of training and ensure all personnel complete required training **Biannually**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   - All personnel in incident response roles must complete initial training within 30 days of assignment and participate in refresher training at least once every six months.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   - Integrate with Learning Management Systems (LMS) to automate the tracking of training completion and provide real-time reports on personnel compliance with training requirements.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   - Personnel must sign a training completion log after each training session. This log will be uploaded to Surveilr, including metadata such as review date and reviewer name to ensure accountability.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be measured against the following criteria:
- 100% of incident response personnel must complete initial and refresher training within the specified timeframes.
- Training completion rates will be reviewed as part of the organization's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. The documentation process requires a formal request outlining the reason for the exception, which will be retained for audit purposes.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All training records must be retained for a minimum of six years from the date of training completion.
- **Policy Review**: This policy will be reviewed and updated annually to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be implemented for all critical actions related to incident response training, and formal documentation will be maintained for all exceptions granted under this policy.
