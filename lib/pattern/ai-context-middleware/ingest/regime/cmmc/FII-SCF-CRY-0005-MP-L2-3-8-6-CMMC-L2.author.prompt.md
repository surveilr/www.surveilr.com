You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: MP.L2-3.8.6 (FII: FII-SCF-CRY-0005). 

Please create the policy document with the following structure and requirements:

1. **Introduction**: Explain the importance of cryptographic mechanisms in preventing unauthorized disclosure of data at rest.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to implementing cryptographic protections.
3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, explicitly including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems that create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties for each role involved (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review) and link to related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Sanction Policy).
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - 1. **REQUIREMENT**: Describe the need for cryptographic mechanisms to protect data at rest.
   - 2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using configuration management tools to verify encryption settings or monitoring logs for encryption compliance.
   - 3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define human verification actions, including the documentation and ingestion method into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline any permissible exceptions to the policy and the process for obtaining approval.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least **annually**').
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
10. **References**: Include a single **References** section at the end of the document, ensuring no References subsections appear after each policy section.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance for every requirement. Use **SMART** instructions and provide a bulleted list of operational steps with associated time-bound metrics for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction. Emphasize and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

Conclude the document with exactly ONE References section, ensuring no control identifiers, metadata, or additional content follow after this section.
