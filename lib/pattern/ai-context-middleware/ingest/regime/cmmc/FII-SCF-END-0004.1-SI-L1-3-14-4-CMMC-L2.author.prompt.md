You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: SI.L1-3.14.4 (FII: FII-SCF-END-0004.1). 

The policy must be structured according to the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

1. Each section must clearly explain the control requirement related to the automatic updating of antimalware technologies, including signature definitions. 
2. For each requirement, provide both **machine attestation** methods and **human attestation** methods where necessary.
3. Include concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation, emphasizing the use of Surveilr for collecting and storing evidence.
4. Define specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) instructions for operational details, including a bulleted list of 3-5 steps for processes like containment or correction, along with a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).
5. Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
6. Provide granular roles and responsibilities, detailing specific tasks, action verbs, and frequency for each role mentioned.
7. Include a dedicated subsection for policy lifecycle requirements, specifying minimum data retention periods and mandatory frequency for the annual review.
8. Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, and mandate comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.
9. The policy must avoid including References subsections within individual policy sections; these should only appear in the final References section at the end of the document.
10. Ensure that the text explicitly uses and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

Finally, ensure that the document ends with exactly ONE References section, formatted as follows: if external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format; if no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".
