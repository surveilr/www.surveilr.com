You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "AC.L2-3.1.15" (FII: "FII-SCF-NET-0014.4"). 

The policy must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. Note that **References subsections should NOT appear within individual policy sections**.

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like containment or violation sanction, include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** along with a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

3. **Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems**, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit security-relevant information.

4. **Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation, emphasizing machine attestability.

5. **Human Attestation**: Define the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr for human attestation when automation is impractical.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section must define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, explicitly linking to related organizational plans.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require **workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, along with comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

9. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

10. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

11. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

12. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

13. **Single References Section**: The document must end with exactly ONE **References** section, listing any external references in the specified format. Ensure no other content follows this section.

14. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

Ensure compliance with these guidelines to achieve a robust, clear policy that maximizes machine attestability and meets all requirements for a 100% compliance score.
