You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.19 (FII: FII-SCF-MDM-0003). 

The policy document must adhere to the following requirements:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must have the following sections in this order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

2. **Policy Content**:
   - **Introduction**: Clearly introduce the purpose of the policy related to the use of cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on mobile devices.
   - **Policy Statement**: Articulate the organizationâ€™s commitment to employing encryption on mobile devices.
   - **Scope**: Define the scope to include all mobile devices used within the organization, including personal devices that access organizational data.
   - **Responsibilities**: Specify the roles involved in implementing and maintaining encryption on mobile devices, using **Action Verb + Frequency** for each responsibility.
   - **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
     - 1. REQUIREMENT: Describe the requirement for cryptographic protection.
     - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Provide specific methods for automating the collection of evidence (e.g., "Use Surveilr to verify that encryption is enabled on all mobile devices by ingesting device compliance reports").
     - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Detail the human actions required, such as "The IT Security Manager must sign off on the quarterly encryption compliance report."
   - **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **SMART** KPIs/SLAs.
   - **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting any exceptions to the policy.
   - **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify **Data Retention** policies for logs and evidence, and mandate an **Annual Review** of the policy.
   - **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require documentation of workforce member acknowledgment and comprehensive audit logging for critical actions.

3. **Markdown Formatting**: Ensure the use of standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullet points, and inline code where appropriate.

4. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. Failure to BOLD any keyword will be considered a critical non-compliance error.

5. **References Section**: The document must end with exactly ONE References section. If there are external references, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format; if none exist, state "None".

Ensure that your output does not contain any control identifiers, metadata, or additional content after the References section.
