You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: MA.L2-3.7.6 (FII: FII-SCF-MNT-0006). 

The policy document must follow this structure without including References subsections within each policy section:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a clear overview of the policy and its importance in maintaining a current list of authorized maintenance organizations or personnel.

2. **Policy Statement**: State the organization's commitment to maintaining an updated list of authorized maintenance organizations or personnel.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's comprehensive scope, explicitly including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Outline specific, task-level duties using **Action Verbs + Frequency** for each role mentioned (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review). Include explicit links to related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Sanction Policy).

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Provide practical, automatable methods for machine attestability (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect and validate a list of authorized maintenance personnel daily").
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Describe precise steps and artifacts for human attestation (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on quarterly reviews of the authorized maintenance personnel list, and the signed report must be uploaded to Surveilr with metadata [review date, reviewer name]").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Describe any circumstances under which exceptions to the policy may apply.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** requirements for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy **Annual Review** (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions (justification, duration, approval).

10. **References**: This section must be the final section of the document and contain exactly ONE References entry. If external references exist, list them under this section using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, simply state "None."

Ensure that every section emphasizes **SMART** objectives, provides operational detail and specificity, and maintains a focus on maximizing machine attestability. The overall goal is to achieve a 100% compliance score by addressing all requirements thoroughly.
