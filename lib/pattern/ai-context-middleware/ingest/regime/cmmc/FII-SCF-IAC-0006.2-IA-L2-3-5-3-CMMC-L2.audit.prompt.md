You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization shall implement and maintain Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all non-privileged accounts accessing the network. MFA will serve as an additional layer of security to verify the identity of users and prevent unauthorized access."
Control Code: IA.L2-3.5.3,
Control Question: Does the organization utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to authenticate network access for non-privileged accounts?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-IAC-0006.2
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the implementation and management of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to authenticate network access for non-privileged accounts. This policy aims to enhance security, reduce the risk of unauthorized access, and ensure compliance with the CMMC control IA.L2-3.5.3. The organization recognizes the importance of MFA as a critical component in protecting sensitive information and systems from unauthorized access. This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party users accessing the organizationâ€™s network and systems."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "OSquery results showing that 90% of non-privileged accounts have MFA enabled for the past month. Signed report from IT manager confirming MFA configurations review dated 2025-07-15."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - IA.L2-3.5.3

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** IA.L2-3.5.3
**Control Question:** Does the organization utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to authenticate network access for non-privileged accounts?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-IAC-0006.2
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization shall implement and maintain Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all non-privileged accounts accessing the network. MFA will serve as an additional layer of security to verify the identity of users and prevent unauthorized access.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** MFA must be enforced on all non-privileged accounts.
    * **Provided Evidence:** OSquery results showing that 90% of non-privileged accounts have MFA enabled.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Evidence collected using OSquery to validate MFA configurations.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM MFA_Configurations WHERE Account_Type = 'non-privileged' AND MFA_Enabled = TRUE.
    * **Compliance Status:** INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
    * **Justification:** While 90% of non-privileged accounts have MFA enabled, the control requires 100% compliance. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate full adherence to the control requirement.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Signed confirmation that MFA configurations have been reviewed.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed report from IT manager confirming MFA configurations review dated 2025-07-15.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** IT manager must review and sign the MFA configuration report.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The signed report is ingested into Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence satisfies the requirement for human attestation as it provides a signed confirmation of the review and aligns with control intent.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence demonstrates that while the organization is making efforts to implement MFA, it does not fully meet the intent of the control due to the 10% of non-compliant accounts.
* **Justification:** The primary intent of the control is to ensure all non-privileged accounts are protected by MFA, which is only partially met based on the evidence provided.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** The control's spirit is compromised by the absence of MFA for 10% of accounts, which could pose a security risk.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** FAIL
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit concludes a "FAIL" due to the insufficient evidence provided to demonstrate that 100% of non-privileged accounts have MFA enabled, which is a direct requirement of the control.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * "Obtain OSquery results showing MFA status for the remaining 10% of non-privileged accounts."
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * "Address the non-compliance for the 10% of non-privileged accounts that do not have MFA enabled. This requires an immediate review and implementation of MFA for these accounts."
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * "Engage the IT Security Team to ensure that MFA is enforced on all non-privileged accounts within 7 days."
    * "Document the remediation process and evidence of compliance for future audits."
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** "Once corrections are made, resubmit the evidence for re-evaluation within 30 days of the audit date."
