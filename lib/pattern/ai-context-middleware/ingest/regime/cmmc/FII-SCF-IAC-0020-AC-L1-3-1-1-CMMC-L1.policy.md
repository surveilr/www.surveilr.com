# CMMC Compliance Policy for Control AC.L1-3.1.1

## Introduction
This policy establishes the requirements for enforcing Logical Access Control (LAC) permissions that conform to the principle of "least privilege." The objective is to ensure that access to electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and other sensitive data is restricted to only those individuals or systems that require it to perform their assigned tasks. This policy applies to all users and systems within our organization, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

## Policy Statement
The organization shall implement logical access controls to enforce the principle of least privilege by defining, managing, and auditing access permissions for all users and systems that interact with ePHI. These controls must be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and organizational standards.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities, including:
- All employees and contractors with access to ePHI.
- Cloud-hosted systems and SaaS applications that handle ePHI.
- Third-party vendor systems that process ePHI.
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Review and update access permissions **Quarterly**. 
- **System Administrators**: Implement and maintain access control measures **Monthly**. 
- **Compliance Officer**: Conduct audits of access controls **Biannually**.
- **All Workforce Members**: Acknowledge understanding and compliance with this policy **Upon Hire** and during **Annual Review**.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT:
Enforce logical access control permissions based on the principle of least privilege.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
Utilize automated tools to generate reports on user access levels, comparing them against defined roles and responsibilities. This data can be ingested into Surveilr for review.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
Conduct user access reviews where system administrators provide documented justification for each user's access level, stored in Surveilr as evidence.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through:
- Automated reports showing that 100% of user access permissions align with defined roles.
- Documentation of user access reviews demonstrating compliance with minimum standards set forth in this policy.
- Evidence of corrective actions taken within **30 days** for any identified discrepancies.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented with a formal request and approved by the Compliance Officer. Exceptions should include a risk assessment and be reviewed **Annually**.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Access logs and evidence must be retained for a minimum of **3 years**.
- **Mandatory Frequency for Policy Review and Update**: This policy shall be reviewed and updated **Annually** to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable regulations and best practices.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging must be maintained for all critical access control changes, and formal documentation must be provided for any exceptions.
