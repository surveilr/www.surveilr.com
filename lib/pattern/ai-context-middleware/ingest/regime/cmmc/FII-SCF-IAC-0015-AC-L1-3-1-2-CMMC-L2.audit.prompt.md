You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure proactive governance of account management for individual, group, system, service, application, guest, and temporary accounts."
Control Code: AC.L1-3.1.2,
Control Question: Does the organization proactively govern account management of individual, group, system, service, application, guest, and temporary accounts?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-IAC-0015
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy establishes a structured approach for the management of individual, group, system, service, application, guest, and temporary accounts, thereby minimizing the risks associated with unauthorized access to electronic protected health information (ePHI). The organization is committed to effectively managing all types of accounts through diligent oversight and governance, ensuring compliance and protecting ePHI."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "1. Daily account activity logs collected using OSquery with a completion rate of 95%. 2. Quarterly account review report signed off by the IT manager and submitted to the Compliance Officer. 3. Monthly report from HR regarding personnel changes impacting account access."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AC.L1-3.1.2

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2023-10-20]
**Auditor Role:** [CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** AC.L1-3.1.2
**Control Question:** Does the organization proactively govern account management of individual, group, system, service, application, guest, and temporary accounts?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-IAC-0015
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To ensure proactive governance of account management for individual, group, system, service, application, guest, and temporary accounts.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Daily collection of account activity logs.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Daily account activity logs collected using OSquery with a completion rate of 95%.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Evidence collected via OSquery.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM account_activity_logs WHERE date >= '2023-10-01' AND date <= '2023-10-20';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided evidence meets the requirement for daily collection with an accuracy rate above 95%, demonstrating effective monitoring of account access.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Quarterly account review sign-off.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Quarterly account review report signed off by the IT manager and submitted to the Compliance Officer.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Signed documentation stored in Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM quarterly_reviews WHERE review_date >= '2023-07-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence shows a completed and signed quarterly review, meeting the compliance requirement for sign-off.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Monthly report from HR on personnel changes.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Monthly report from HR regarding personnel changes impacting account access.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** HR is responsible for compiling and providing the report.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Report stored in Surveilr's documentation records.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The HR report is provided consistently and meets the requirements for attestation of personnel changes.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the organization is effectively managing account governance in alignment with the control’s intent.
* **Justification:** The evidence shows proactive governance through regular monitoring and review processes, ensuring compliance with the control’s spirit.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** N/A

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence provided meets all requirements of the control, demonstrating effective governance over account management, with satisfactory machine and human attestations.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:** N/A
