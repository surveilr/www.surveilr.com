# Log Processing Failure Alerting Policy

## Introduction
This policy establishes the framework for alerting appropriate personnel in the event of a log processing failure, thereby ensuring that the organization can promptly address disruptions. Effective log monitoring and alerting are critical to maintaining operational integrity and compliance with the **CMMC** requirements.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to alerting designated personnel immediately upon detection of a log processing failure. This policy mandates timely actions to remedy any disruptions in log processing to ensure continuous monitoring and compliance with **CMMC** control AU.L2-3.3.4.

## Scope
This policy applies to all systems and environments within the organization, including cloud-hosted systems, **SaaS** applications, and systems managed by third-party vendors. It encompasses all personnel involved in log monitoring and incident response.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Monitor logs and alert personnel **Daily** regarding log processing failures.
- **System Administrators**: Investigate and remediate log processing failures **Immediately** upon notification.
- **Compliance Officer**: Review incident reports and ensure compliance with this policy **Monthly**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must alert appropriate personnel when a log processing failure occurs, ensuring timely remediation actions.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Integrate with monitoring systems to capture alerts automatically, ensuring logs of failures are retained for auditing purposes.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Personnel must document actions taken in response to alerts, including timestamps and resolution details, to provide attestation artifacts.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following **SMART** objectives:
- 100% of log processing failures must result in alerts being sent to designated personnel within 5 minutes (**Specific**).
- 95% of log processing failures must be resolved within 1 hour (**Measurable**).
- Review of alerts and responses must occur **Monthly** to ensure adherence (**Achievable**).
- Documentation of incidents must be completed within 24 hours of resolution (**Relevant**).
- A completion rate of 100% for documentation audits must be maintained (**Time-bound**).

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented in writing and approved by the Compliance Officer. This documentation will outline the rationale for the exception and the timeframe for its review.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Logs related to log processing failures must be retained for a minimum of 12 months.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions. Any exceptions must be formally documented and reviewed as part of the audit process.
