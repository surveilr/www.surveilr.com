You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: SC.L1-3.13.1 (FII: FII-SCF-NET-0003). 

### Policy Authoring Instructions:

1. **Document Structure**: 
   - Organize the policy into the following sections: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**.
   - Use H2 headings (##) for each major section.

2. **Introduction**: 
   - Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance in relation to monitoring and controlling communications at the external network boundary and key internal boundaries.

3. **Policy Statement**: 
   - Clearly articulate the organization's stance on network security and communication monitoring.

4. **Scope**: 
   - Define the policy's scope explicitly, covering all relevant entities and environments including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

5. **Responsibilities**: 
   - Detail specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using **Action Verb + Frequency**. Link to related organizational plans where applicable.

6. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use the structured format: 
     - 1. REQUIREMENT:
     - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
     - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - For each requirement, suggest practical machine attestation methods and, where necessary, specific human attestation actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.

7. **Verification Criteria**: 
   - Define clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs** established in the Evidence Collection Methods.

8. **Exceptions**: 
   - Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for documenting these exceptions.

9. **Lifecycle Requirements**: 
   - Include a subsection detailing **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: 
    - Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

11. **Markdown Formatting**: 
    - Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code for technical terms.

12. **References**: 
    - Ensure that the References section appears only at the very end of the document and does not appear after individual policy sections.

13. **Keyword Emphasis**: 
    - Use and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

14. **Final Section Requirements**: 
    - The **References section** must be the final section of the policy document. 

### Output Requirements:
- Do not include any SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.
- The generated policy document must end with exactly ONE References section.

### Note:
Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections.
