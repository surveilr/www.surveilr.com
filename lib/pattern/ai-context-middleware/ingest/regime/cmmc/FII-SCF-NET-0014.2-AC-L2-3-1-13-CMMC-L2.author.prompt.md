You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.13 (FII: FII-SCF-NET-0014.2). 

Please structure the policy as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the purpose and importance of using cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to utilizing cryptographic mechanisms for remote access sessions.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope of this policy, ensuring to include cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

4. **Responsibilities**: Outline specific, task-level duties for roles involved in implementing and maintaining this policy, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - 1. **REQUIREMENT**: Explain the necessity of cryptographic mechanisms for remote access sessions.
   - 2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using Surveilr to verify encryption protocols for remote access.
   - 3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify actions a human must perform, including documentation of any manual checks or certifications.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Describe any exceptions to this policy, including any required documentation and approval processes.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update, ensuring to include an **Annual Review** requirement.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the policy document, listing relevant external resources using [Link Text](URL) format. 

Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections, and conclude the policy document with exactly ONE References section. Emphasize the importance of **SMART** instructions throughout the policy, and ensure every requirement includes attestation guidance to maximize machine attestability.
