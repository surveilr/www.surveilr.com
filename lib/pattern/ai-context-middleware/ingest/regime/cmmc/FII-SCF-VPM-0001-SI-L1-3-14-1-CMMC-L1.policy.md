# Vulnerability Management Policy

## Introduction
This policy outlines the requirements for implementing and monitoring vulnerability management controls to protect the organization's information systems from vulnerabilities. Vulnerability management is a critical aspect of maintaining the security and integrity of systems, applications, and data. This policy seeks to ensure that all assets are regularly assessed for vulnerabilities and that appropriate remediation actions are taken promptly.

## Policy Statement
The organization shall implement a comprehensive vulnerability management program that includes the identification, assessment, and remediation of vulnerabilities across all systems and applications. The policy mandates that vulnerabilities are monitored continuously, and remediation efforts are documented and reported to ensure compliance with security standards.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational assets, including:

- **Cloud-hosted systems**
- **SaaS applications**
- **Third-party vendor systems**
- **On-premises systems and applications**

All personnel, including employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access these systems, are required to comply with this policy.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Conduct vulnerability assessments and coordinate remediation efforts **monthly**.
- **System Administrators**: Ensure systems are patched and vulnerabilities are remediated **within 30 days** of identification.
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and update this policy **annually** and ensure adherence to **Data Retention** requirements.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT:
Regular identification and remediation of vulnerabilities across all systems.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
- Use **OSquery** to collect asset inventories and vulnerability data **daily**.
- Utilize vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., Nessus, Qualys) to perform automated scans **weekly** and generate reports.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
- The IT Security Team will compile a **monthly vulnerability assessment report**.
- The Compliance Officer will sign and submit a **quarterly summary report** documenting remediation efforts into Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be measured against the following **KPIs/SLAs**:

- Vulnerability scans completed **within 7 days** of the scheduled date.
- Remediation of critical vulnerabilities **within 30 days**.
- Documentation of all remediation efforts submitted **monthly**.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Any exceptions will be reviewed **quarterly** to ensure that they remain valid and necessary.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- All evidence logs must be retained for a minimum of **two years**.
- This policy must be reviewed and updated **annually** to remain effective and relevant.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All critical actions related to vulnerability management must be logged, and workforce members must acknowledge their understanding of this policy through an attestation process. Audit logs will be reviewed by the Compliance Officer **quarterly** to ensure adherence to this policy.
