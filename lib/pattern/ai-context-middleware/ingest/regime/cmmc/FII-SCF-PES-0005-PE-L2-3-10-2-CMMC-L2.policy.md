# Physical Security Incident Monitoring Policy (Control: PE.L2-3.10.2)

## Introduction
Monitoring, detecting, and responding to physical security incidents is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring the integrity of organizational assets. Effective physical security measures help mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access, theft, or damage, thereby protecting both the organization and its stakeholders.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to maintaining robust physical security measures that comply with relevant regulations and standards. We will actively monitor, detect, and respond to physical security incidents to ensure the safety and security of our facilities, personnel, and sensitive information.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors involved with any entity or environment where sensitive information is created, received, maintained, or transmitted. This includes but is not limited to on-premises facilities, cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

## Responsibilities
- **Security Personnel**: **Monitor** security systems **continuously** for suspicious activity.
- **Incident Response Team**: **Investigate** reported incidents **immediately** to determine the nature and impact.
- **IT Staff**: **Review** access control logs **daily** for unauthorized access attempts.
- **Management**: **Conduct** training sessions on incident response procedures **annually**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: It is required to actively monitor physical security incidents to ensure compliance and safety.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automated methods for evidence collection include integrating surveillance systems and maintaining access control logs to capture data on physical access events.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Personnel must document all incidents in an incident log, detailing the nature of the incident, response actions taken, and outcomes. This documentation must be completed **immediately** following an incident.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the establishment of clear, measurable criteria tied to **KPIs/SLAs** such as:
- Number of incidents detected and reported within a specified timeframe.
- Average response time to physical security incidents.
- Percentage of personnel trained on security incident procedures.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented using a formal exception request process, which must include justification and approval from management.

## Lifecycle Requirements
All evidence and logs related to physical security incidents must be retained for a minimum of **Data Retention** period of **two years**. This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to physical security incidents, and formal documentation must be created for all exceptions.
