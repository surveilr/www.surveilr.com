# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Policy for Sensitive/Regulated Data Access

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive framework for enforcing **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for sensitive and regulated data access within our organization. The significance of this policy lies in its ability to safeguard sensitive information and ensure compliance with applicable regulations, thereby protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of sensitive data, including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). This policy aligns with the CMMC control AC.L2-3.1.3 and supports our commitment to secure data management practices.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to enforcing a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** policy that governs access to sensitive and regulated data. This policy ensures that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data based on their defined roles, adhering to the principle of **least privilege** and the **need-to-know** basis.

## Scope
This policy applies to all **cloud-hosted systems**, **SaaS applications**, **third-party vendor systems**, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. The scope includes all users, roles, and systems that interact with sensitive/regulated data, ensuring consistent access control across the organization.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - **Develop** and maintain RBAC framework **Annually**.
  - **Review** access roles and responsibilities **Quarterly**.
  
- **Data Owners**: 
  - **Define** and update role definitions and access levels **As Needed**.
  - **Approve** access requests and modifications **Weekly**.
  
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - **Audit** RBAC implementation and adherence **Bi-Annually**.
  - **Report** compliance status to leadership **Quarterly**.

- **All Employees**: 
  - **Acknowledge** understanding of access controls **Upon Hire** and **Annual Training**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: A **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** policy is essential to manage user access to sensitive data systematically, ensuring compliance with regulations and minimizing security risks.
  
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Practical methods for automated evidence collection include leveraging **API integrations** to verify access controls, logging access attempts, and generating reports that confirm compliance with RBAC policies.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Necessary human actions include maintaining **signed access review logs** after periodic reviews and ensuring that all access requests are documented and approved by relevant data owners.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be established through the following SMART criteria:
- **Monthly Review Completion Rate**: 100% completion of access reviews by the Data Owners.
- **Audit Findings**: No critical findings during **Bi-Annual Audits** by the Compliance Officer.
- **Access Request Processing Time**: 95% of access requests processed within 5 business days.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by the Compliance Officer. All exception requests must be documented, outlining the rationale for the exception and any potential risks.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Access logs must be retained for a minimum of **5 years**.
- **Policy Review**: This policy shall be reviewed and updated **Annually** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be mandated for all critical actions related to access control to ensure accountability and traceability.
