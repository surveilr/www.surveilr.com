# Separation of Duties Policy

## Introduction
Separation of Duties (SoD) is a critical internal control mechanism designed to prevent inappropriate activities within our organization without collusion. By distributing responsibilities across multiple individuals, SoD helps mitigate the risk of fraud, error, and unauthorized access to sensitive information, including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). This policy ensures that no single individual has the authority to execute all phases of a critical process, thus safeguarding our organization’s integrity and compliance with applicable regulations.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to implementing and maintaining a robust Separation of Duties framework to ensure that key processes involving access to ePHI are conducted with appropriate checks and balances. This commitment extends to all personnel and systems involved in handling sensitive information.

## Scope
This policy applies to all cloud-hosted systems, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. It encompasses all organizational units and personnel who have access to or manage sensitive information.

## Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team**: Conduct a monthly review of user access rights to ensure compliance with SoD principles.
- **HR Department**: Annually update and document roles and responsibilities related to SoD.
- **Compliance Officer**: Perform quarterly audits of SoD compliance and report findings to senior management.
- **All Employees**: Participate in SoD training biannually and acknowledge understanding of their specific responsibilities.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**:
   The organization must implement and maintain SoD to prevent potential inappropriate activity without collusion.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**:
   Utilize OSquery to collect user access logs daily to verify compliance with SoD policies across all systems.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**:
   The Compliance Officer must sign off on the quarterly review of SoD compliance, documenting findings and any necessary corrective actions.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this SoD policy will be validated through the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- 100% of user access rights reviewed monthly.
- 100% completion of annual role documentation by the HR Department.
- 100% of quarterly audits completed by the Compliance Officer with no unresolved findings.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented with a clear justification and submitted for approval to the Compliance Officer. The exception documentation will include the rationale for the deviation and the duration for which the exception is valid.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to SoD compliance must be retained for a minimum of six (6) years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an annual review to ensure its effectiveness and alignment with organizational objectives and regulatory requirements.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding of this policy and their compliance responsibilities. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to SoD, ensuring transparency and accountability.
