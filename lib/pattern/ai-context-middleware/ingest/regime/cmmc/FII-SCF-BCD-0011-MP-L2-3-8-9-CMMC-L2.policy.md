# CMMC Policy Document for Control: MP.L2-3.8.9 (FII: FII-SCF-BCD-0011)

## Introduction
This policy outlines the framework for creating recurring backups of data, software, and system images, as well as verifying the integrity of these backups. The importance of this policy lies in its role in ensuring data availability, which is critical for meeting Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs). By implementing this policy, the organization demonstrates its commitment to maintaining operational continuity and safeguarding vital information against potential data loss.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to creating and maintaining recurring backups of all critical data, software, and system images. Furthermore, the integrity of these backups will be verified regularly to ensure that data can be restored promptly and accurately in the event of a disruption.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit data

## Responsibilities
- **IT Department**: Conduct backups daily.
- **System Administrators**: Verify backup integrity weekly.
- **Data Owners**: Review backup reports monthly.
- **Compliance Officer**: Audit backup processes quarterly.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**:
   The organization must create recurring backups of data, software, and system images, and verify the integrity of these backups to ensure data availability and compliance with RTOs and RPOs.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**:
   Automated scripts will be employed to perform checksum verifications on backup files, ensuring that they match the original data. Logs of these verifications will be ingested into Surveilr for real-time monitoring and reporting.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**:
   A designated manager will sign off on backup verification reports monthly. These reports will be stored in a secure document repository, and the signed documents will be ingested into Surveilr for compliance tracking.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be measured against the following criteria:
- 100% of scheduled backups completed as per the defined frequency.
- 95% of backup integrity checks passed without discrepancies.
- Timely submission of monthly backup verification reports by data owners.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented, including a justification for the exception and approval from the Compliance Officer. This documentation will be maintained in a secure repository and reviewed during quarterly audits.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Backup evidence must be retained for a minimum of 7 years.
- **Policy Review**: This policy will be reviewed and updated annually to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with evolving standards.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to backup processes. Formal documentation will be required for all exceptions, ensuring transparency and accountability.
