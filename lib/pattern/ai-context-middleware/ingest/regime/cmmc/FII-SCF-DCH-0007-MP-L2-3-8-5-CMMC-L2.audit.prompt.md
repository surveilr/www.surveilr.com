You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To protect and control digital and non-digital media during transport outside of controlled areas using appropriate security measures."
Control Code: MP.L2-3.8.5,
Control Question: Does the organization protect and control digital and non-digital media during transport outside of controlled areas using appropriate security measures?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-DCH-0007
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish protocols for the protection and control of digital and non-digital media during transport outside of controlled areas. This policy is critical in safeguarding sensitive information, including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), from unauthorized access, loss, or damage during transit, thereby ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and maintaining the integrity of our information systems. The organization is committed to protecting and controlling media during transport outside of controlled areas. This commitment includes implementing appropriate security measures to mitigate risks associated with the movement of sensitive information."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Automated tracking systems for media movements, including GPS tracking logs, transport logs documenting media details and routes, and signatures from sender and receiver personnel."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - MP.L2-3.8.5

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** MP.L2-3.8.5
**Control Question:** Does the organization protect and control digital and non-digital media during transport outside of controlled areas using appropriate security measures?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-DCH-0007
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To protect and control digital and non-digital media during transport outside of controlled areas using appropriate security measures.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Protect and control media during transport to prevent unauthorized access, loss, or damage.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated tracking systems for media movements, including GPS tracking logs.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Evidence collected via automated tracking systems.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SQL query verifying media transport logs against tracking systems.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the organization has automated tracking systems in place that log movements of media, ensuring accountability during transport.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Document transport logs, including details of the media, transport route, and signatures from both the sender and receiver.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Transport logs documenting media details and signatures from sender and receiver personnel.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Transport personnel must document transport logs as outlined in the policy.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Surveilr records the act of human attestation through transport logs.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The transport logs provided include all necessary details and signatures, confirming that the transport procedures are being followed.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided demonstrates that the organization is protecting and controlling media during transport effectively.
* **Justification:** The combination of machine attestation through automated tracking and human attestation via transport logs aligns with the controlâ€™s intent to safeguard sensitive information during transit.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** N/A

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence collectively demonstrates compliance with the control requirements, ensuring that digital and non-digital media are protected and controlled during transport outside of controlled areas.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * N/A
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * N/A
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * N/A
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** N/A
