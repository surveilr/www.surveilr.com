You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: SC.L2-3.13.13 (FII: FII-SCF-END-0010). 

The policy must include the following sections in the exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Each section should include:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the purpose of the policy and its relevance to mobile code and operating system-independent applications.
  
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to addressing mobile code and ensuring compliance with relevant standards.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, particularly covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format. Ensure to link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Follow this mandatory structure:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily.").
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define exact actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting any policy exceptions, including required justifications.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

The policy must maximize machine attestability, with every section including attestation guidance. Ensure that all relevant operational details are **SMART**, with specific, measurable actions and timelines for processes like containment and remediation. 

Importantly, do NOT include References subsections within policy sections. The References section must appear only at the end of the document. 

Finally, ensure that the policy text explicitly uses and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

Finish the document with exactly ONE References section, ensuring no additional content follows it.
