You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.18 (FII: FII-SCF-MDM-0007). 

Please follow these instructions:

1. **Document Structure**: Organize the policy into the following sections without any References subsections within them: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. Ensure the policy ends with exactly ONE References section.

2. **Policy Content**: For each section, include the following:
   - **Control Requirement**: Clearly explain the control requirement related to prohibiting the installation of non-approved applications or approved applications not obtained through the organization-approved application store.
   - **Machine Attestation Methods**: Suggest specific, practical methods to validate compliance automatically, such as using OSquery to collect data on installed applications or utilizing API integrations to check application approval status.
   - **Human Attestation Methods**: Where automation is impractical, describe specific actions a human must take, the artifacts they must produce, and how these will be documented and ingested into Surveilr.

3. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant,** and **Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like violation sanctions, include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

4. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems, as well as all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

5. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

6. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed)**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

7. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned in the Responsibilities section and link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

8. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

11. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined in the SMART instructions.

12. **Markdown Formatting**: Utilize standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

13. **Hyperlinks**: Use the format [Link Text](URL) for external references.

14. **Prohibited Content**: Avoid SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code. 

15. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

16. **Final Section Requirements**: Ensure that the References section is the final section of the policy document, and no additional content follows it.

17. **References Section Format**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by "None".

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance in every section.
