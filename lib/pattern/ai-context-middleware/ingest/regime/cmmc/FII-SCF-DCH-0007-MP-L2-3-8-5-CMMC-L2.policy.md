# Media Protection Policy for Transport

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish protocols for the protection and control of digital and non-digital media during transport outside of controlled areas. This policy is critical in safeguarding sensitive information, including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), from unauthorized access, loss, or damage during transit, thereby ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and maintaining the integrity of our information systems.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to protecting and controlling media during transport outside of controlled areas. This commitment includes implementing appropriate security measures to mitigate risks associated with the movement of sensitive information.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all relevant entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## 4. Responsibilities
- **IT Security Team + Daily**: Ensure that all media transport protocols are established, documented, and communicated to all relevant personnel.
- **Operations Team + Per Transport Event**: Conduct secure packaging and labeling of media prior to transportation.
- **Compliance Officer + Quarterly**: Review and update the policy to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
- **Transport Personnel + Per Transport Event**: Execute transport procedures and maintain transport logs detailing the media handled.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Protect and control media during transport to prevent unauthorized access, loss, or damage.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize automated tracking systems to log movements of media, including GPS tracking and secure transport protocol verification, to ensure accountability.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Transport personnel must document transport logs, including details of the media, transport route, and signatures from both the sender and receiver. Certification of secure handling must also be completed by all personnel involved.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be established using **SMART** criteria:
- **Specific**: Identify and log every instance of media transport.
- **Measurable**: Maintain a log that includes timestamps and personnel involved in the transport.
- **Achievable**: Ensure that all transport events are completed according to protocol.
- **Relevant**: Align with regulatory requirements for ePHI protection.
- **Time-bound**: Assess compliance on a monthly basis. **KPIs/SLAs** will include a 100% log completion rate for transport events.

## 7. Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted under special circumstances. The process for documenting and approving exceptions includes:
- Submission of a formal request to the Compliance Officer.
- Review and approval by the IT Security Team.
- Documentation of the exception, including the rationale and duration.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All transport logs and evidence must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for all critical actions related to media transport. Formal documentation for all exceptions must be recorded and accessible for audit purposes.
