You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: CA.L2-3.12.2 (FII: FII-SCF-IAO-0005). 

The policy must follow this structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, and References**. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the purpose of the policy regarding the generation of a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to document planned remedial actions for security control deficiencies.
  
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to documenting weaknesses or deficiencies and the corrective actions planned.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities, environments, and third-party systems associated with information assurance.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for roles such as Compliance Officer, IT Security, and Risk Management, ensuring clarity on responsibilities related to the POA&M.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Describe the requirement for generating a POA&M.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest specific, automatable methods for documenting and validating the POA&M using Surveilr (e.g., "Automatically ingest POA&M updates into Surveilr from project management tools").
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Outline precise steps and artifacts needed for human attestation, such as signing off on updates to the POA&M.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs** (e.g., "POA&M updates must be reviewed and approved within 30 days of identification of deficiencies").

7. **Exceptions**: Define the process for documenting exceptions to the policy, including required approvals and justifications.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., "Retain POA&M records for a minimum of 6 years") and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., "Reviewed at least annually").

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance for both machine and human methods for each requirement.

11. Avoid including any **References** subsections within policy sections; the **References** section should only appear at the very end of the document.
