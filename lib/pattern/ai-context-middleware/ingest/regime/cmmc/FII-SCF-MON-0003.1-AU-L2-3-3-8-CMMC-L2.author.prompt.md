You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AU.L2-3.3.8 (FII: FII-SCF-MON-0003.1). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Introduction**: Introduce the purpose of the policy and its importance in protecting sensitive/regulated data in log files.
   
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organizationâ€™s commitment to protecting sensitive/regulated data within log files.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope of the policy to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format (e.g., IT Security: daily log review). Ensure to link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery actions.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings per requirement: 
     - "1. REQUIREMENT:"
     - "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:"
     - "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:"
   - For each requirement, explain the control requirement, suggest machine attestation methods, and describe specific human attestation methods when necessary.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** KPIs/SLAs defined in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including justification and approval processes.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least **annually**').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Conclude the policy document with exactly ONE References section at the end. The References section should not appear after each policy section. 

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by including concrete examples of automated evidence collection and documentation methods. All keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** must be emphasized in **bold** throughout the document. 

No SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code should be included in the policy.
