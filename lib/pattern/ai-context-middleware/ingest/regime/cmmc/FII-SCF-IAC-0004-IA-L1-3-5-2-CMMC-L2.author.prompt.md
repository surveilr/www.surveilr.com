You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: IA.L1-3.5.2 (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0004). 

The policy document must be structured as follows:

## Introduction
- Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance in ensuring device identification and authentication.

## Policy Statement
- Clearly state the organization's commitment to uniquely identifying and centrally authenticating devices using bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically-based and replay-resistant.

## Scope
- Define the scope explicitly to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- Detail specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved in the policy's implementation and oversight, including links to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:** Describe the requirement for unique identification and authentication of devices.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using API integrations to validate authentication logs and device inventories.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Specify the actions human personnel must take, including signing off on quarterly validation reports for device authentication.

## Verification Criteria
- Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

## Exceptions
- Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification, duration, and approval.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail minimum **data retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., retain for 6 years) and state the mandatory frequency for policy review and updates (e.g., **Annual Review**).

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
