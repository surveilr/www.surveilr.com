You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: MP.L2-3.8.1 (FII: FII-SCF-DCH-0001). 

### Policy Structure
1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy and its importance in facilitating data protection controls.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to implementing data protection controls.
3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, such as Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: daily log review. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the data protection control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using OSquery to collect asset inventories daily or API integrations with cloud providers to validate access controls.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Provide precise steps for human actions required, including artifacts and ingestion methods into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Outline clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the **SMART** KPIs/SLAs defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.
7. **Exceptions**: Describe any exceptions to the policy and the process for documenting them.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., retain for 6 years) and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., reviewed at least **annually**).
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
10. **References**: Conclude the document with exactly ONE References section, ensuring that no References subsections appear after each policy section.

### Additional Instructions
- Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance for each requirement.
- Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions, particularly for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction.
- Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
- Emphasize the following keywords in **BOLD**: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

### Important Note
- Ensure the policy does NOT include SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code. The References section should only appear at the end of the document, without subsections in individual policy sections.
