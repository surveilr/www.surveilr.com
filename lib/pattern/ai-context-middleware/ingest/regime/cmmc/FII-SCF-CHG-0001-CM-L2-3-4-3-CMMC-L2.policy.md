# Change Management Policy

## 1. Introduction
The Change Management Program is a critical component of our organization's operational framework, ensuring that all changes to systems, processes, and applications are conducted in a controlled and systematic manner. This program minimizes the risk of disruptions, enhances security, and maintains compliance with regulatory requirements. By effectively managing changes, we can safeguard our sensitive information, including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), and ensure the integrity and availability of our services.

## 2. Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to implementing a robust Change Management Program that governs all changes to our systems and processes. This program is designed to ensure that changes are planned, assessed, approved, and documented, thereby minimizing potential risks and ensuring compliance with applicable standards.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Change Manager**: **Review** change requests **daily** for completeness and compliance with policy.
- **IT Staff**: **Implement** approved changes **as scheduled** and **document** all actions taken in the change log.
- **Compliance Officer**: **Audit** change management processes **quarterly** to ensure adherence to policy and regulatory requirements.
- **Department Heads**: **Approve** change requests **within 48 hours** of submission to ensure timely processing.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must implement a Change Management Program to ensure all changes are systematically managed and documented.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize API integrations with change management tools (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira) to automatically log changes and validate compliance with the policy.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Managers must **sign off** on all change requests and submit them to Surveilr via a designated upload method, ensuring proper documentation and traceability.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following **SMART** objectives:
- **Specific**: 100% of change requests must be documented and approved.
- **Measurable**: 95% of changes must be implemented within the scheduled timeframe.
- **Achievable**: All staff must receive training on change management procedures **annually**.
- **Relevant**: Changes must align with organizational goals and compliance requirements.
- **Time-bound**: All audits must be completed within 30 days of the end of each quarter.

**KPIs/SLAs** will be established to track the performance of the Change Management Program, including the percentage of changes implemented on time and the number of exceptions documented.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and include a justification for the deviation. Approval must be obtained from the Change Manager and the Compliance Officer before proceeding with any exceptions.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to change management must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy must be reviewed and updated **annually** to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to change management, and formal documentation will be required for all exceptions.
