You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: AC.L2-3.1.4 (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0011). 

The policy must follow this structure:

## Introduction
- Explain the importance of Separation of Duties (SoD) in preventing inappropriate activities without collusion.

## Policy Statement
- Clearly state the organization's commitment to implementing and maintaining SoD.

## Scope
- Define the scope of the policy, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties (Action Verb + Frequency) for each role related to the policy.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT:
   - Explain the control requirement for SoD.
   
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect user access logs daily").

3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - Describe specific steps and artifacts for human attestation (e.g., "The Compliance Officer must sign off on the quarterly review of SoD compliance").

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

## Exceptions
- Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification and approval.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., "retain for 6 years") and the frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Mandate workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

### References
- Include any external references used in the policy at the end of the document. Ensure that References subsections do NOT appear after each policy section, and only one References section is present at the document's end.
