You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "SC.L2-3.13.16" (FII: "FII-SCF-END-0002"). 

The policy must follow this structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Each section should be comprehensive, addressing every rule in the 'Requirements for the Policy Document' section, and must maximize machine attestability. 

1. **Introduction** - Clearly state the purpose and importance of protecting the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and safety of endpoint devices.

2. **Policy Statement** - Articulate the organizationâ€™s commitment to endpoint security and the overarching goals of this policy.

3. **Scope** - Explicitly define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and **all channels** used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities** - Define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned, such as Compliance Officer: **quarterly policy approval**; IT Security: **daily log review**. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, **Sanction Policy**) for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods** - Use numbered subheadings per requirement:
   - "1. REQUIREMENT:"
   - "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:" - Describe practical, automatable methods for machine attestability.
   - "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:" - Describe specific actions, artifacts, and how they are ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria** - Provide clear and measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions** - Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification, duration, and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements** - Detail minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least **annually**').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit** - Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that every section includes attestation guidance, emphasizing machine attestability wherever possible. Use **SMART** instructions and provide a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, including a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA) for each.

The References section must be the final section of the document, and there should be no References subsections within individual policy sections. 

Make sure to **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

End the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
