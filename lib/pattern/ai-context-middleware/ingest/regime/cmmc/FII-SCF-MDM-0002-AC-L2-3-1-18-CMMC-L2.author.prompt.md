You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "AC.L2-3.1.18" (FII: "FII-SCF-MDM-0002"). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** 

1. **Introduction:** Provide a clear overview of the policy's purpose and its relevance to mobile device management.

2. **Policy Statement:** Define the organization's commitment to enforcing access control requirements for the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems.

3. **Scope:** Explicitly define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities:** Outline specific, task-level duties for each role (e.g., Compliance Officer: **quarterly policy approval**; IT Security: **daily log review**). Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery actions.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods:** Use numbered subheadings for each requirement:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Explain the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect mobile device compliance data daily").
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Specify actions, artifacts, and how they are ingested into Surveilr (e.g., "IT manager must sign off on the quarterly mobile device inventory report").

6. **Verification Criteria:** Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to **SMART** instructions and **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions:** Describe any exceptions to the policy and the process for documenting them.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements:** Detail **minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs (e.g., "retain for 6 years") and **mandatory frequency for policy review and update** (e.g., "reviewed at least annually").

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit:** Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

The policy MUST maximize machine attestability and provide attestation guidance in each section. It should include **specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)** instructions, with a bulleted list of **3-5 operational steps** and a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)** where applicable.

Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections. The document must end with exactly ONE References section. 

Ensure that the keywords **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are **BOLD** throughout the policy for emphasis. 

Output the policy document accordingly.
