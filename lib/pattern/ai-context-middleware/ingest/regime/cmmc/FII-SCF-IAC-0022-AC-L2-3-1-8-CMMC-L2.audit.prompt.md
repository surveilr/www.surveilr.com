You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization enforces a limit on consecutive invalid login attempts by a user. Accounts will be automatically locked after a specified number of unsuccessful attempts within a defined time period to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access."
Control Code: AC.L2-3.1.8,
Control Question: Does the organization enforce a limit for consecutive invalid login attempts by a user during an organization-defined time period and automatically locks the account when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded?
Internal ID (Foriegn Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-IAC-0022
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):** 
    "This policy outlines the requirements for limiting consecutive invalid login attempts and implementing account lockout procedures to enhance security within the organization. It is designed to comply with the CMMC control AC.L2-3.1.8 and ensure that user authentication processes are robust, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. The organization enforces a strict limit on consecutive invalid login attempts by a user. Accounts will be automatically locked after a specified number of unsuccessful attempts within a defined time period. This policy aims to mitigate the risk of brute force attacks and unauthorized access to sensitive information."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "OSquery results confirming that accounts are locked after 5 unsuccessful login attempts within a 15-minute period. Account lockout incidents logged and reviewed within 24 hours. Signed management approval of account lockout logs for the last month."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - AC.L2-3.1.8

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** [AC.L2-3.1.8]
**Control Question:** [Does the organization enforce a limit for consecutive invalid login attempts by a user during an organization-defined time period and automatically locks the account when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded?]
**Internal ID (FII):** [FII-SCF-IAC-0022]
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** [The organization enforces a limit on consecutive invalid login attempts by a user. Accounts will be automatically locked after a specified number of unsuccessful attempts within a defined time period to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.]

## 1. Executive Summary

The audit findings indicate that the organization successfully implements the control requirements for limiting consecutive invalid login attempts and account lockout procedures. Evidence collected demonstrates compliance with the control's intent and requirements, resulting in a **PASS** audit decision.

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Accounts must lock after 5 unsuccessful login attempts within a 15-minute period.
    * **Provided Evidence:** OSquery results confirming that accounts are locked after 5 unsuccessful login attempts within a 15-minute period.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery for endpoint data.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM login_attempts WHERE attempts > 5 AND timestamp < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '15 MINUTE';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The OSquery results clearly demonstrate that the control requirement is met, showing that account lockouts occur as specified.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** All account lockouts must be logged and reviewed within 24 hours.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Account lockout incidents logged and reviewed within 24 hours.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated logging of account lockout events.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM account_lockouts WHERE review_timestamp < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '24 HOUR';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided evidence confirms timely logging and review of account lockout incidents, aligning with the control's requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Managerial approval of account lockout logs.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed management approval of account lockout logs for the last month.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Management must review and approve account lockout incidents.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Record of signed management approval stored within Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed approval indicates that the necessary human attestation is in place for the account lockout logs.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are met in practice.
