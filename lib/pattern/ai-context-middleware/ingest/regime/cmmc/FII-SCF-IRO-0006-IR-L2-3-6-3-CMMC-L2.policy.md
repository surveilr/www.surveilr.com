# Incident Response Testing Policy

## Introduction
This policy establishes the framework for formally testing incident response capabilities to ensure the operational effectiveness of those capabilities, in compliance with CMMC control IR.L2-3.6.3. It is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) across all systems and processes.

## Policy Statement
The organization shall conduct **realistic exercises** to formally test incident response capabilities at least **biannually**. These exercises will evaluate the performance of response teams, identify gaps, and ensure readiness to respond to potential incidents involving ePHI.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## Responsibilities
- **Incident Response Team (IRT)**: 
  - **Conduct** incident response exercises **biannually**.
  - **Evaluate** participant performance and document findings **immediately** following exercises.
  - **Update** response plans based on findings **within 30 days** post-exercise.
  
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - **Review** and ensure policy adherence **annually**.
  - **Maintain** records of exercises and compliance documentation **for 6 years**.

- **IT Security Staff**: 
  - **Support** IRT in facilitating exercises **per event**.
  - **Log** all critical actions in audit trails **real-time**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Conduct formal incident response testing.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
   - Automated logging of exercise participation via incident management systems.
   - Metrics from performance evaluation tools to assess response times and effectiveness.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
   - IRT members must sign off on exercise reports in Surveilr, confirming their participation and feedback.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with the policy will be validated through:
- Successful completion of incident response exercises **biannually** (KPIs/SLAs).
- Documentation of updates made to response plans post-exercise, assessed through audit logs.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented formally, including:
- Justification for the exception.
- Duration of the exception.
- Approval from the Compliance Officer.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to incident response exercises must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure continued relevance and compliance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy **upon onboarding** and **annually thereafter**.
- Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to incident response exercises, including exceptions.
