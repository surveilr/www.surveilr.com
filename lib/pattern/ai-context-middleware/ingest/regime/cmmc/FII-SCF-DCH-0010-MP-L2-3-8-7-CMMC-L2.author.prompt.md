You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "MP.L2-3.8.7" (FII: "FII-SCF-DCH-0010"). 

## Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the policy's purpose and importance in the context of data classification and handling.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on restricting the use of types of digital media on systems or system components.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, explicitly including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Outline specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in policy enforcement, including links to related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Sanction Policy).

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Detail the specific control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect digital media usage logs weekly").
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Describe precise actions, artifacts, and how they should be ingested into Surveilr (e.g., "IT manager must sign the digital media usage report quarterly").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the **SMART** objectives and **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Describe any potential exceptions to the policy and the process for their approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **Final Section Requirements**: End the policy document with exactly ONE References section, ensuring that no References subsections appear after individual policy sections.
