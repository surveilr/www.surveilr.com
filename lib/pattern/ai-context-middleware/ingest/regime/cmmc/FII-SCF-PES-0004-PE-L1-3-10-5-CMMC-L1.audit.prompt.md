**[START OF GENERATED PROMPT MUST CONTENT]**

You're an **official auditor (e.g., CMMC Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** CMMC
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization identifies systems, equipment, and respective operating environments that require limited physical access so that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms, and facilities."
  * **Control Code:** PE.L1-3.10.5
  * **Control Question:** Does the organization identify systems, equipment, and respective operating environments that require limited physical access so that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms, and facilities?
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-PES-0004
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy establishes the framework for identifying and controlling physical access to systems, equipment, and environments that require limited access to ensure the security of sensitive information, particularly electronic protected health information (ePHI). By maintaining stringent physical and environmental security measures, the organization mitigates risks associated with unauthorized access, safeguarding critical assets and complying with relevant regulatory requirements. The organization is committed to identifying systems, equipment, and respective operating environments that require limited physical access. This commitment ensures that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms, and facilities housing sensitive information."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Automated inventory management system logs tracking locations of sensitive systems, access logs from centralized logging solutions, security officer inspection reports documented in Surveilr, and access control system logs maintained in Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: CMMC - PE.L1-3.10.5

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [CMMC Auditor]
**Control Code:** PE.L1-3.10.5
**Control Question:** Does the organization identify systems, equipment, and respective operating environments that require limited physical access so that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms, and facilities?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-PES-0004
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization identifies systems, equipment, and respective operating environments that require limited physical access so that appropriate physical access controls are designed and implemented for offices, rooms, and facilities.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Identify systems, equipment, and environments needing limited physical access.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated inventory management system logs tracking locations of sensitive systems and access logs from centralized logging solutions.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion from inventory management system and centralized logging systems to track and validate access.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM access_logs WHERE system_location IN (SELECT location FROM sensitive_systems);
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided evidence includes automated logs that confirm the organization's ability to track sensitive systems effectively.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Implement physical access controls.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Access control system logs maintained in Surveilr.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Usage of access control systems with automatic ingestion of log data into Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM access_control_logs WHERE access_time > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** Evidence shows comprehensive logging of access attempts, indicating that physical access controls are implemented.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Conduct physical inspections of access points.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Security officer inspection reports documented in Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Security officers conducting inspections and documenting findings.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Reports recorded in Surveilr, confirming inspections were conducted.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The documentation of inspections indicates that human attestation is in place and functioning as required.
