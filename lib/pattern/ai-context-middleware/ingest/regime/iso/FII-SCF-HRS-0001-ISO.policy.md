# Personnel Security Controls Policy

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for implementing and maintaining personnel security controls within the organization. Personnel security is a critical aspect of safeguarding sensitive information, including electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). By ensuring that appropriate security measures are in place, we aim to protect our assets, mitigate risks, and promote a culture of security awareness among our workforce.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to implementing and maintaining effective personnel security controls to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of ePHI and other sensitive information. This commitment encompasses all personnel, including employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to our systems and data.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all relevant entities and environments within the organization, including cloud-hosted systems, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **HR Department**: Conduct background checks **upon hiring** and ensure ongoing personnel monitoring **annually**.
- **Security Team**: Provide security training to all personnel **upon onboarding** and conduct refresher training **annually**.
- **Management**: Review and approve personnel security policies **quarterly** and sign off on background check documentation **upon hiring**.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization will implement mechanisms for conducting background checks, providing security training, and ongoing personnel monitoring. This includes maintaining written policies and procedures governing these processes.
   
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Evidence will be collected through automated ingestion of background check reports and access control records into Surveilr. This will facilitate real-time monitoring and compliance validation.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Management will review and sign off on background check policies, ensuring all documentation is uploaded to Surveilr for accountability and transparency.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through **SMART** **KPIs/SLAs** linked to the effectiveness of personnel security controls. This includes:
- 100% completion rate of background checks for new hires within 30 days.
- 95% participation rate in security training sessions **annually**.
- Ongoing personnel monitoring conducted with documented reviews every 6 months.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by upper management. Documentation of exceptions must include a justification for the deviation and will be submitted to Surveilr for record-keeping and audit purposes.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
All evidence and logs related to personnel security controls will be retained for a minimum of **Data Retention** period of 7 years. The policy will undergo a mandatory **Annual Review** to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members are required to acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for critical actions, and formal documentation will be required for any exceptions granted under this policy.
