You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** ISO 27001:2022
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization facilitates the identification and implementation of relevant statutory, regulatory, and contractual controls."
    * Control Code: FII-SCF-CPL-0001
    * Control Question: Does the organization facilitate the identification and implementation of relevant statutory, regulatory, and contractual controls?
    * Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-CPL-0001
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "In today's rapidly changing regulatory landscape, it is critical for organizations to identify and implement relevant statutory, regulatory, and contractual controls to ensure compliance and mitigate risks. These controls help safeguard organizational integrity, enhance operational efficiency, and protect stakeholder interests. By adhering to applicable laws and standards, organizations can foster trust with customers, partners, and regulatory bodies while minimizing legal liabilities. [Organization Name] is committed to maintaining compliance with all applicable statutory, regulatory, standards, and contractual controls. This commitment encompasses ongoing monitoring, assessment, and implementation of relevant controls to ensure alignment with legal and contractual obligations."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "1. Automated tracking system implemented for applicable laws and regulations is operational. 2. Periodic gap assessment reports generated and stored in Surveilr system. 3. Compliance training completion rates logged showing 100% completion for the past year. 4. Signed log of compliance assessments conducted by responsible personnel is available."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: ISO 27001:2022 - FII-SCF-CPL-0001

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., ISO Compliance Auditor]
**Control Code:** FII-SCF-CPL-0001
**Control Question:** Does the organization facilitate the identification and implementation of relevant statutory, regulatory, and contractual controls?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-CPL-0001
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization facilitates the identification and implementation of relevant statutory, regulatory, and contractual controls.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Automated tracking of applicable laws and regulations.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated tracking system implemented and operational.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion via Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM laws WHERE status='active';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence confirms that an automated system for tracking applicable laws and regulations is in place and operational.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Periodic gap assessment reports.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Gap assessment reports generated and stored in the Surveilr system.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated report generation and storage.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM gap_assessments WHERE date >= '2025-01-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The organization successfully generates and maintains periodic gap assessment reports, demonstrating compliance with the control.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Compliance training completion rates.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Training completion rates logged showing 100% completion for the past year.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Logged data in Surveilr for compliance training.
