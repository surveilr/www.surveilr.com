# Standardized Operating Procedures (SOP) Documentation Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the identification and documentation of Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) within the organization, ensuring that all employees have access to clear, concise, and up-to-date instructions necessary for the effective execution of their day-to-day tasks. This documentation is vital for consistency, compliance, and efficiency in operations.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to identifying, creating, and maintaining comprehensive documentation of Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) or similar documentation. This commitment ensures that all operational activities are carried out in a uniform manner, promoting accountability and compliance with applicable standards and regulations.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities, including:
- All departments and teams within the organization.
- Cloud-hosted systems.
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications utilized by the organization.
- Third-party vendor systems that support operational activities.

## Responsibilities
- **Department Heads**: Identify and document SOPs, review annually.
- **SOP Authors**: Create and update SOPs, ensure clarity and accessibility, quarterly.
- **Compliance Officers**: Review SOPs for compliance with regulations, biannually.
- **IT Staff**: Maintain version control and access logs for SOPs, monthly.
- **All Employees**: Familiarize and comply with relevant SOPs, ongoing.

## Evidence Collection Methods

### 1. REQUIREMENT
The organization must identify and document SOPs to enable the proper execution of day-to-day tasks, ensuring that all procedures are standardized and accessible.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION
Utilize automated documentation tools to maintain versioning logs. For example, implement a document management system that tracks changes and provides audit trails for SOP documents.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION
Staff must perform the following actions:
- Review the SOPs relevant to their role and confirm understanding by signing an acknowledgment form, to be stored in Surveilr.
- Submit feedback on SOP clarity and effectiveness through an electronic form, integrated into Surveilr for analysis.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated based on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- 100% of identified SOPs must be documented and accessible to relevant personnel.
- All SOPs must undergo annual review with at least 90% of SOPs updated within the review cycle.
- Audit logs must reflect all changes made to SOPs, with an error rate of less than 5% in document versioning.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted under specific circumstances. Requests for exceptions must be submitted in writing to the Compliance Officer, who will review and approve or deny the request, documenting the rationale for the decision.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: SOPs must be retained for a minimum of 5 years post-creation or last revision.
- **Annual Review**: All SOPs must be reviewed at least once a year to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for all critical actions related to SOP documentation, including creation, modification, and approval. Any exceptions must be formally documented and stored in Surveilr.
