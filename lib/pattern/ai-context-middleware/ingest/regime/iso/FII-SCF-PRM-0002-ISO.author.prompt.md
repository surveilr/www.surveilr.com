You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : (FII: FII-SCF-PRM-0002). 

The policy must follow this structure without including any References subsections in the sections, and must end with exactly ONE References section. 

1. **Introduction:** Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and relevance to the organizationâ€™s capital planning and investment requests related to cybersecurity and data privacy.

2. **Policy Statement:** Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to address all capital planning and investment requests, including resources needed to implement cybersecurity and data privacy programs.

3. **Scope:** Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities:** Define specific, task-level duties for each role involved in the capital planning process. Include action verbs and frequency (e.g., "Compliance Officer: quarterly review of budget proposals").

5. **Evidence Collection Methods:**
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Explain the requirement to document all capital planning and investment requests.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest methods such as collecting budget proposals or investment plans with cybersecurity and data privacy components via Surveilr.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Specify actions like a manager's signature on project proposals and how these are documented and ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria:** Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to KPIs/SLAs defined in the policy.

7. **Exceptions:** Outline the process for documenting exceptions to the capital planning requirement, including responsibilities for review and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements:** Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit:** Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References:** This section must list any external references used in the policy in the format: [Link Text](URL), but ensure that this is the only section where references are provided.

Ensure to use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code for technical terms. Highlight and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the policy. 

Remember, no SQL queries or code should be included in the policy, and the policy document must end with exactly ONE References section.
