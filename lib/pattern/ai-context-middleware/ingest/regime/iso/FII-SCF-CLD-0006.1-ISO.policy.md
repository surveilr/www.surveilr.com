## Introduction

In the context of cloud security, organizations must establish clear delineations of responsibilities between the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and its customers. The Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) serves as a critical tool for ensuring that both parties understand their obligations regarding security controls. This policy outlines the requirements for documenting and maintaining a CRM, ensuring compliance with ISO standards and enhancing transparency in cloud service agreements.

## Policy Statement

The organization shall formally document a Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) that clearly delineates the responsibilities of the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and its customers concerning security controls. The CRM shall be reviewed and updated **annually** to ensure its relevance and accuracy. 

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All **cloud-hosted systems**.
- **SaaS applications** utilized by the organization.
- **Third-party vendor systems** that interact with the organization’s data.
- All channels related to creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting **ePHI**.

The CRM must encompass all security controls relevant to the systems and applications included in this scope.

## Responsibilities

- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - Ensure the CRM is documented and updated **annually**.
  - Review and approve the CRM for compliance with organizational policies.
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - Collaborate with the Compliance Officer to develop and maintain the CRM.
  - Conduct regular reviews of the CRM against current cloud service agreements and security standards.
- **Workforce Members**: 
  - Acknowledge and attest to their understanding of the CRM and related responsibilities.
  - Follow the guidelines outlined in the CRM to ensure compliance.
  
All responsibilities are linked to the organization's **Incident Response Plan**, **Disaster Recovery Plan**, and **Sanction Policy** to ensure a coordinated approach to compliance.

## Evidence Collection Methods

- The CRM must be accessible to all relevant stakeholders.
- Evidence of annual reviews, updates, and workforce member attestations must be logged and retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- Audit logs must demonstrate compliance with the CRM at least **quarterly**.

## Exceptions

Any exceptions to the CRM must be formally documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. This documentation should outline the reason for the exception and the duration for which it is valid. All exceptions will be logged as part of the audit process.

## Lifecycle Requirements

- The CRM shall be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- A review of the CRM must occur **annually**, and updates must be documented and communicated to all stakeholders.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
