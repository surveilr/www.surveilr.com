You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "FII-SCF-OPS-0001" (FII: ). 

## Introduction
- Provide an overview of the importance of operational security controls in the organization's security framework.

## Policy Statement
- Clearly state the organization's commitment to facilitating the implementation of operational security controls.

## Scope
- Define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data.

## Responsibilities
- Outline specific, task-level duties for each role involved in operational security controls, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format (e.g., "Security Manager: monthly review of access control logs").

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   - Detail how operational security controls are implemented in day-to-day activities.
   
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   - Suggest methods for automated evidence collection, such as:
     - "Use SIEM dashboards to monitor real-time security alerts."
     - "Ingest change management logs into Surveilr for daily compliance checks."

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   - Provide specific actions for human verification, such as:
     - "The Compliance Officer must review and sign the governance framework documentation quarterly."
     - "Attestation logs must be uploaded to Surveilr with metadata (review date, reviewer name)."

## Verification Criteria
- Define clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **KPIs/SLAs** established in the Evidence Collection Methods.

## Exceptions
- Specify the process for requesting exceptions to the policy and the documentation required for approval.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Include requirements for **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., "retain for 6 years") and the **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Mandate workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

### References
- Provide a list of references used to formulate the policy, using the format [Link Text](URL). If no external references exist, state "None." 

Ensure not to include References subsections within individual policy sections, and conclude the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
