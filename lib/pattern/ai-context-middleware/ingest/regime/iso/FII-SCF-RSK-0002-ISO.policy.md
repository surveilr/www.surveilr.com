# Information Classification Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this Information Classification Policy is to establish a framework for categorizing systems and data within the organization in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. Proper categorization is crucial to safeguard sensitive information, ensure appropriate handling, and mitigate risks associated with data breaches and non-compliance.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to effectively categorizing all systems and data to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. This policy aims to establish a consistent and systematic approach to information classification, ensuring that all sensitive information is appropriately protected and managed throughout its lifecycle.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: Quarterly policy approval; annual compliance audit.
- **IT Security**: Daily log review; monthly categorization validation.
- **Asset Owner**: Review and approve classification decisions; annual review of asset categorization.
- **Data Steward**: Document security categorization results; facilitate training on classification process.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Document the security categorization results, including supporting rationale, in the security plan for systems.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize API integrations with system classification tools to automatically validate categorized assets and ensure compliance.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Require the asset owner to sign the classification documentation, which is then uploaded to Surveilr along with relevant metadata (review date, reviewer name).

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated based on the following criteria:
- Accurate documentation of security categorization results and rationale.
- Evidence of asset owner review and approval for all categorization decisions.
- Adherence to established KPIs and SLAs related to classification processes.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must follow a documented process that includes:
- Justification for the exception
- Duration of the exception
- Required approvals from the Compliance Officer

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs related to classification must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- **Annual Review**: The policy will be reviewed and updated annually or as required by changes in legislation or organizational structure.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy.
- Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions, including creation, modification, and termination of classification documentation.
- Any exceptions will require formal documentation detailing justification, duration, and approval.
