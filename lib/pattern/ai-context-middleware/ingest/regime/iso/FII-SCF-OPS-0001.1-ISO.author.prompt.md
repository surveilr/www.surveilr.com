You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "Does the organization identify and document Standardized Operating Procedures (SOP), or similar documentation, to enable the proper execution of day-to-day / assigned tasks?" (FII: FII-SCF-OPS-0001.1). 

Your policy must adhere to the following structure and requirements:

1. **Introduction**: Clearly define the purpose of the policy regarding SOP documentation.
2. **Policy Statement**: Outline the organization's commitment to documenting SOPs.
3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope, including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role involved in SOP documentation, using **Action Verbs + Frequency**.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings per requirement:
     1. **REQUIREMENT:** Explain the control requirement.
     2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest automatable evidence collection methods. For example, "Use OSquery to collect documentation versioning logs."
     3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Describe precise actions a human must perform, including the exact artifacts and how they will be ingested into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Define any exceptions to the policy and the process for approval.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods for SOPs and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.
10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document that does not appear after each policy section. Provide a formatted list of external links if applicable.

Remember to prioritize machine attestability in each section, and ensure that all instructions are **SMART** (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Time-bound). Do not include SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code in the policy. 

End the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
