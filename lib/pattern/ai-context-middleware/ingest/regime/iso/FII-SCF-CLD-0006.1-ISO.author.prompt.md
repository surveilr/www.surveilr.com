You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization formally document a Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM), delineating assigned responsibilities for controls between the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and its customers?" (FII: FII-SCF-CLD-0006.1). 

The policy document must follow this structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. Ensure there are no References subsections within individual policy sections, and the document must end with exactly ONE References section.

Each policy section must include:
1. An explanation of the control requirement.
2. Machine attestation methods, detailing practical, automated evidence collection methods.
3. Human attestation methods, specifying actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr.

Use **H2 headings** for each major requirement and adhere to the following guidelines:
- Include **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions, particularly for operational details and processes related to containment, correction, or violation sanction.
- Provide a comprehensive scope definition that includes **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems,** and **all channels** related to creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting ePHI.
- Clearly define the **Responsibilities** section with specific, task-level duties for each role, and link to any related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Sanction Policy).
- Detail **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and the **mandatory frequency** for policy review and update.
- Mandate **workforce member acknowledgment/attestation** of understanding and compliance, along with **comprehensive audit logging** for all critical actions and formal documentation for exceptions.
- Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code.
- Ensure that the policy emphasizes and **BOLDs** the keywords: **SMART, KPIs/SLAs, Action Verb + Frequency, Data Retention,** and **Annual Review**.

The final section must include the **References** section formatted as follows: if external references exist, list them under **### References** using [Link Text](URL) format; if none exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None". 

Do not include control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content after the References section.
