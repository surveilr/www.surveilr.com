# Personnel Security Risk Management Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a systematic process for managing personnel security risk by screening individuals prior to granting them access to sensitive information and systems. Effective screening serves as a foundational element in safeguarding the organization against insider threats and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to mitigating personnel security risks by implementing a thorough screening process for all individuals who require access to sensitive information and systems. This policy is guided by the principles of due diligence, privacy, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who require access to sensitive information or systems, including but not limited to:
- On-premises systems
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information

## Responsibilities
- **HR Manager**: conduct background checks for new hires prior to access approval.
- **IT Security Officer**: verify that access controls are aligned with screening results on a **quarterly** basis.
- **Compliance Officer**: review and update screening procedures **annually** to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.
- **Department Managers**: report any personnel security incidents and ensure compliance within their teams on an **ongoing** basis.

For additional guidance, refer to the Incident Response Plan and Sanction Policy.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization must ensure that all individuals who are authorized to access sensitive information undergo a robust screening process.
  
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Implement API integrations with third-party background check services to automate the collection of screening completion evidence. This ensures a verifiable record of all screenings conducted.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Maintain signed background check records that are uploaded to Surveilr. This documentation must be accessible for review and audit purposes.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
- Percentage of new hires screened prior to access approval (target: 100%).
- Frequency of background check audits conducted (target: bi-annual).
- Timeliness of screening completion relative to access requests (target: within 5 business days).

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented, including:
- Justification for the exception
- Duration of the exception
- Approval from the Compliance Officer

## Lifecycle Requirements
### Data Retention
All screening records must be retained for a minimum of **7 years** from the date of the individual's termination or end of access.

### Annual Review
This policy will be reviewed and updated on an **annual** basis to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with relevant regulations.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions, and formal documentation must be created for all exceptions to the policy.
