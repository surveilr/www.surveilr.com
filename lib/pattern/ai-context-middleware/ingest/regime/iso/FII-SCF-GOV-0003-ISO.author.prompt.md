You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: FII-SCF-GOV-0003). 

## Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the importance of reviewing the cybersecurity & data privacy program, including policies, standards, and procedures. 

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to reviewing these elements at planned intervals or when significant changes occur.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope of the policy to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved in the review process, such as:
   - Compliance Officer: **Quarterly review** of policy documents.
   - IT Security: **Monthly analysis** of control test reports.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement for reviewing the cybersecurity & data privacy program.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest machine attestation methods, such as using version control systems to track policy revisions and ensuring automated alerts for scheduled reviews.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify the human attestation methods, such as requiring signatures on review reports, with documents uploaded to Surveilr including metadata (reviewer name, date, outcome).

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for handling exceptions to the policy, including justification, duration, and approval requirements.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., retain for **6 years**) and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., **reviewed at least annually**).

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a single section at the end of the document for references, formatted as [Link Text](URL).

### Final Instructions
- Ensure that the policy avoids any **References subsections** within individual sections.
- Conclude the document with exactly ONE **References** section.
- Emphasize and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the policy text.
