You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: FII-SCF-GOV-0002). 

Please follow these instructions to create a compliant policy document:

1. **Document Structure**: Ensure the policy includes the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

2. **Markdown Elements**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. 

3. **Attestation Guidance**: For each section, provide detailed guidance:
   - **Machine Attestation**: Describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection. For example, "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily."
   - **Human Attestation**: Specify precise actions, required artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr. For example, "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly software inventory report."

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **SMART** instructions. Include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** and **specific time-bound metrics (KPIs/SLAs)** for processes like containment and correction. 

5. **Scope Definition**: Define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

6. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

7. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when automation is impractical.

8. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: In the Responsibilities section, define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using **Action Verb + Frequency**. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

11. **Verification Criteria**: Outline clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in operational steps.

12. **Prohibited Content**: Do not include SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code. Focus on describing methods.

13. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

14. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

15. **References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end, without any References subsections in individual policy sections.

16. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

17. **Final Section Requirements**: Ensure the **References section is the FINAL section** of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else.

Please begin drafting the policy now, ensuring not to include any References subsections within the policy sections, and end the document with exactly ONE References section.
