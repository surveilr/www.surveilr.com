You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0003.1). 

The policy document must follow this structure without including References subsections in any section, and it must end with exactly ONE References section. The policy should be comprehensive and guide the AI to produce robust, clear, and primarily machine-attestable policies. 

1. **Introduction**: Introduce the purpose of the policy and its importance in maintaining a safe and secure working environment.
  
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly define the organization's commitment to communicating roles and responsibilities related to information security.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope of the policy, including all relevant entities, such as employees, contractors, and any systems involved in creating, maintaining, or transmitting sensitive information.

4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned (e.g., HR: conduct annual training; IT Security: oversee compliance assessments) with explicit action verbs and frequencies.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. **REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement for communicating user roles and responsibilities.
   - 2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automated methods to validate compliance, such as tracking training completion via a Learning Management System (LMS).
   - 3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define actions for human evidence, such as maintaining signed training completion logs submitted to Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs** (e.g., 100% completion of training within 30 days of employment).

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the approval process for such exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence (e.g., retain training records for 6 years) and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., reviewed at least annually).

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: The final section must contain exactly ONE References section formatted with external links where applicable, or state "None" if there are no external references.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by providing concrete examples of automated evidence collection and validation, along with explicit human attestation methods when necessary. Use standard Markdown formatting, emphasizing **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the document. 

Remember, do not include any SQL queries or code blocks, and ensure that the References section is the last part of the document.
