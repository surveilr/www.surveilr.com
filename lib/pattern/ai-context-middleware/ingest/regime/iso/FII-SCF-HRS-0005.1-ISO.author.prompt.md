You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0005.1). 

The policy must include the following sections in the specified order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. Ensure that the document structure uses H2 headings (##) for each section and that no References subsections appear within any policy section. The References section should be the final section of the document.

1. **Introduction**: Clearly explain the purpose of the policy regarding acceptable and unacceptable rules of technology use.
2. **Policy Statement**: Define the organization's stance on acceptable use and the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities, environments, and technologies.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define **specific, task-level duties** (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role regarding policy enforcement and review.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use the following structure:
     - **1. REQUIREMENT**: State the control requirement.
     - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence (e.g., using OSquery or API integrations).
     - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify the exact actions, artifacts, and how they will be documented and ingested into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Describe how exceptions to the policy are handled and documented.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include details on **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require **workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, and **comprehensive audit logging** for all critical actions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by prioritizing automated evidence collection and specifying human attestations only when necessary. Remember to **bold** all mandated keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

Conclude the policy document with exactly one **References** section.
