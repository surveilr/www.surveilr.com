You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "" (FII: FII-SCF-GOV-0001.2). 

Please ensure the following structure for the policy document:

## Introduction
- Explain the purpose of the policy and its importance in providing governance oversight reporting and recommendations related to the organization's cybersecurity & data protection program.

## Policy Statement
- Clearly state the policy requirements and commitments regarding governance oversight.

## Scope
- Define the comprehensive scope of the policy, covering all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- Specify granular roles and responsibilities, detailing specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role involved in governance oversight.

## Evidence Collection Methods
### 1. REQUIREMENT:
- Describe the mechanisms for governance oversight reporting and recommendations.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
- Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence of compliance, such as using documentation of policies, meeting minutes, and risk assessment reports.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
- Define the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr, such as requiring signed meeting minutes to be uploaded with relevant metadata (review date, reviewer name).

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

## Exceptions
- Detail the process for documenting any exceptions to the policy, including justification, duration, and approval.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Include a dedicated subsection for minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

### References
- Ensure that all references are listed in a single section at the end of the document, avoiding References subsections in individual policy sections.

Please prioritize machine attestability in all sections and include explicit human attestation where necessary. Ensure that all instructions are **SMART**, operational details are specific, and every requirement is addressed comprehensively. 

End the policy document with exactly ONE References section and do not include any control identifiers, metadata, or additional content outside of the policy structure.
