# ISO Compliant Policy Document for Control: FII-SCF-RSK-0006.1

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive framework for responding to findings from cybersecurity and data privacy assessments, incidents, and audits. This policy aims to ensure that the organization identifies, addresses, and remediates any vulnerabilities or non-compliance issues effectively, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of our information systems.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to addressing all findings from cybersecurity assessments, data privacy evaluations, incidents, and audits with urgency and diligence. We shall implement corrective actions and remediation measures to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

## Scope
This policy applies to all relevant entities and environments within the organization, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications

- **IT Security Team**: Perform **daily monitoring** of remediation actions and provide updates on incident resolution.
- **Data Privacy Officer**: Oversee compliance with data privacy regulations and ensure timely reporting of assessments.
- **Incident Response Team**: Execute the incident response plan and document all remediation efforts.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: 
   Organizations must respond to findings from cybersecurity assessments and incidents by implementing corrective actions within a defined timeframe to ensure proper remediation.
