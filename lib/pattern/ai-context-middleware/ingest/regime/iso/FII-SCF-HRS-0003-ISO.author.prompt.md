You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization define cybersecurity roles & responsibilities for all personnel?" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0003). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, and References**. 

1. **Introduction**: Clearly state the purpose and importance of defining cybersecurity roles and responsibilities within the organization.

2. **Policy Statement**: Articulate the organization's commitment to establishing and documenting cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for all personnel.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope to encompass all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties for each role involved in cybersecurity, using **Action Verbs + Frequency**. Include explicit links to related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Sanction Policy).

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings for each requirement:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement related to defining roles and responsibilities.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence, such as using organizational charts and job descriptions.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify the actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods for human evidence, such as maintaining training records and signed acknowledgments.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for requesting them.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for **Annual Review**.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

The policy must maximize machine attestability and include attestation guidance for each section. Ensure that the text uses standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullets, and **bold** text for the keywords **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections. The **References** section must appear only at the end of the document.
