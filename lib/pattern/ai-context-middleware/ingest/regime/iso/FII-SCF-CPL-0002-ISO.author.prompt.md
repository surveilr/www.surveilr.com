You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "" (FII: FII-SCF-CPL-0002). 

## Policy Structure Instructions:
1. **Introduction**: Provide a clear overview of the policy's intent regarding cybersecurity and data protection controls oversight.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to establishing a cybersecurity and data protection controls oversight function that reports to executive leadership.
3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy to cover all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Outline specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved in the oversight function. For example, define the responsibilities of the Compliance Officer, IT Security, and executive leadership.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Clearly explain the oversight function and its reporting structure.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe automated methods for evidence collection, such as organizational chart data ingestion via Surveilr.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify human actions required, including documentation of oversight meetings and decisions.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Define measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the defined KPIs/SLAs.
7. **Exceptions**: Detail any exceptions to the policy and the process for requesting them.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, along with comprehensive audit logging for critical actions.
10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document. Do not include References subsections within any policy sections.

## Additional Instructions:
- Use H2 headings (##) for each major requirement.
- The policy must maximize machine attestability, with every policy section including attestation guidance.
- Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions, especially in operational details and processes.
- Ensure all **KPIs/SLAs** are defined and referenced appropriately.
- Use standard Markdown elements, including paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
- The document must contain **BOLD** keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

At the end of the policy document, ensure there is exactly ONE References section, formatted as per the guidelines provided. Do not include any supplementary content, control identifiers, or metadata after the References section.
