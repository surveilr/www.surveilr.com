You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: FII-SCF-GOV-0004). 

The policy document must follow this structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by including specific machine and human attestation methods for each requirement. 

Each section should include:

1. **Control Requirement**: Clearly explain the control requirement.
2. **Machine Attestation**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
3. **Human Attestation**: Provide specific, verifiable actions that a human must perform (e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly software inventory report").

Use H2 headings (##) for major requirements and follow the mandatory order of sections. Please avoid including References subsections within policy sections; the References section should only appear at the very end of the document.

All statements must be **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)**. Include operational steps and specific time-bound metrics (KPIs/SLA) where applicable. Define the policy's scope comprehensively, covering all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

In the Responsibilities section, clearly define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned, and link to related organizational plans as necessary. Include a subsection detailing **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs, **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**, and require formal documentation for audits.

Ensure that the document emphasizes the following **keywords** in **BOLD**: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

Format the document using standard Markdown elements, including paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Use the hyperlinks format [Link Text](URL) for any external references. The References section must be the final section of the policy document, containing exactly ONE reference list or indicating "None" if no external references exist.

Please begin the policy creation.
