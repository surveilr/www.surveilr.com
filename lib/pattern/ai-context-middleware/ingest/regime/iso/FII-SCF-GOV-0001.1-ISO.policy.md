## 1. Introduction
In todayâ€™s digital landscape, the integration of cybersecurity, data protection, and business objectives is paramount for maintaining organizational integrity and trust. A formal steering committee or advisory board ensures that these critical areas are aligned, fostering a proactive approach to risk management and compliance. This structured coordination enables organizations to respond effectively to emerging threats and regulatory requirements, ultimately supporting strategic business initiatives.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization commits to establishing and maintaining a steering committee or advisory board composed of key cybersecurity, data privacy, and business executives. This committee will meet formally and on a regular basis to oversee and coordinate efforts in cybersecurity and data protection, ensuring alignment with business objectives.
