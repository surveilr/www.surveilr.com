You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : (FII: FII-SCF-GOV-0005). 

## Instructions for Policy Authoring:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy MUST follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Ensure that each section explains the control requirement, suggests machine attestation methods, and includes human attestation methods where necessary.

2. **Markdown Elements**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Ensure that all sections are formatted correctly.

3. **Attestation Guidance**:
   - **Machine Attestation**: Describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection, such as "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily."
   - **Human Attestation**: Define precise actions, artifacts, and how they will be documented in Surveilr, e.g., "The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly performance report."

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)** for processes like containment or correction.

5. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

6. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

7. **Explicit Human Attestation**: When necessary, define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

8. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section must define specific duties for each role and link to related organizational plans for escalation or recovery actions.

9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, as well as comprehensive audit logging for critical actions.

11. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods, avoiding SQL queries or code blocks, and do NOT include References subsections within policy sections.

12. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

13. **Verification Criteria**: Define clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation that tie back to the KPIs/SLAs established in the policy.

14. **Hyperlinks**: Use the [Link Text](URL) format for external references, ensuring all links are correctly formatted.

15. **Single References Section**: The document must conclude with exactly ONE References section at the very end, containing either external references in the correct format or "None" if there are no external references.

16. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text MUST explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

17. **Final Section Requirements**: Ensure the **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document**. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content.

### End of Instructions

Now, proceed to author the policy document following the guidelines above, ensuring no References subsections appear after each policy section and that the document ends with a single References section.
