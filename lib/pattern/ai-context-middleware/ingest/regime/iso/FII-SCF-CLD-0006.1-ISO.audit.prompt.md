You're an **official auditor (e.g., ISO Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** ISO 27001
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure that both the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and the customer understand their respective responsibilities regarding security controls."  
Control Code: FII-SCF-CLD-0006.1,  
Control Question: Does the organization formally document a Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM), delineating assigned responsibilities for controls between the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and its customers?  
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-CLD-0006.1
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**  
"The organization shall formally document a Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) that clearly delineates the responsibilities of the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and its customers concerning security controls. The CRM shall be reviewed and updated annually to ensure its relevance and accuracy. This policy applies to all cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications utilized by the organization, third-party vendor systems that interact with the organization’s data, and all channels related to creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting ePHI. All responsibilities are linked to the organization's Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, and Sanction Policy to ensure a coordinated approach to compliance."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:**  
"Evidence includes: 
- Automated tools have been used to collect evidence of the CRM documentation stored in a secure repository.
- Cloud service agreements monitored for changes via version control systems.
- Workforce members have submitted a signed acknowledgment of the CRM via the organization’s compliance portal.
- Regular audits have been documented in audit logs."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: ISO 27001 - FII-SCF-CLD-0006.1

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** ISO Auditor
**Control Code:** FII-SCF-CLD-0006.1
**Control Question:** Does the organization formally document a Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM), delineating assigned responsibilities for controls between the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and its customers?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-CLD-0006.1
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To ensure that both the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and the customer understand their respective responsibilities regarding security controls.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The CRM must be documented and accessible to all relevant stakeholders.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated tools have collected evidence of the CRM documentation stored in a secure repository.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Evidence was collected via automated tools that query the secure repository.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM crm_documentation WHERE accessible = TRUE;
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence provided shows that the CRM documentation is stored securely and is accessible as required.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Evidence of annual reviews and updates of the CRM.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Cloud service agreements monitored for changes via version control systems.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Version control system tracked changes and updates.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM version_control_logs WHERE document = 'CRM' AND action = 'update';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided evidence indicates that the CRM is reviewed and updated as per the policy requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Workforce members must submit a signed acknowledgment of the CRM.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed acknowledgment of the CRM submitted via the compliance portal.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Workforce members are required to sign and submit acknowledgment forms.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Evidence of signed acknowledgments stored in the compliance portal.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
