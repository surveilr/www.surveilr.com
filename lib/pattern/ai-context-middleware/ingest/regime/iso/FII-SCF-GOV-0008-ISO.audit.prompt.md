You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** ISO 27001:2022
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization shall develop and maintain a comprehensive document outlining the context of its business model and articulate its mission."
Control Code: FII-SCF-GOV-0008,
Control Question: Does the organization define the context of its business model and document the mission of the organization?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-GOV-0008
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish mechanisms that define the context of the organization's business model and document its mission. This policy aligns with the ISO 27001:2022 framework, specifically focusing on Cybersecurity & Data Protection Governance. The organization shall develop and maintain a comprehensive document outlining the context of its business model and articulate its mission. This document will serve as a foundational element for the Information Security Management System (ISMS) and will ensure that all stakeholders understand the organizational objectives and the strategic importance of cybersecurity within the business context."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "The organization provided a documented context and mission statement. Evidence includes a version history report from the content management system (CMS), digital signatures of key stakeholders acknowledging the document upon its initial release and during the Annual Review, and records of acknowledgments submitted to Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: ISO 27001:2022 - FII-SCF-GOV-0008

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., ISO Auditor]
**Control Code:** FII-SCF-GOV-0008
**Control Question:** Does the organization define the context of its business model and document the mission of the organization?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-GOV-0008
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization shall develop and maintain a comprehensive document outlining the context of its business model and articulate its mission.

## 1. Executive Summary

The audit findings indicate that the organization has successfully defined the context of its business model and documented its mission as required. The evidence provided demonstrates compliance with the control requirements, including a documented context statement, version history, and stakeholder acknowledgments. No significant evidence gaps were identified.

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Document outlining the context and mission of the organization.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Documented context and mission statement with a version history report from the CMS.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** The CMS generated reports tracking changes and version history.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM context_document WHERE approved = 'TRUE';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence provided meets the control requirement by clearly articulating the context of the business model and is adequately documented and versioned.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Digital signature mechanism records approvals.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Digital signatures of key stakeholders acknowledging the document.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Digital signature logs are securely stored and track approvals.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM approval_logs WHERE document_id = 'FII-SCF-GOV-0008';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The organization implemented a digital signature mechanism that effectively records all approvals, meeting the control's requirements.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Acknowledgment of the document by key stakeholders.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed acknowledgments submitted to Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Key stakeholders signed the document upon its release and during the annual review.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The signed acknowledgments were ingested into Surveilr for audit purposes.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed acknowledgments confirm that relevant stakeholders are aware of and have accepted the context document, fulfilling the control requirement.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the organization's documented context and mission align with the intended purpose of the control.
* **Justification:** The documentation and acknowledgment processes reflect the organization's commitment to cybersecurity and data protection governance, as outlined in the policy.
