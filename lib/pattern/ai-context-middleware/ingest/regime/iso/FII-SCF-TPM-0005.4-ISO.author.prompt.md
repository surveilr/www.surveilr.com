You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : FII-SCF-TPM-0005.4. 

## Instructions for Policy Authoring:

1. **Document Structure**: Use the following sections in this order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Do not include References subsections within policy sections; the References section must be at the end of the document.

2. **Policy Content**:
   - **Introduction**: Describe the purpose of the policy regarding the RASCI matrix and its significance in delineating responsibilities for cybersecurity and data privacy controls.
   - **Policy Statement**: Clearly define the organization's commitment to maintaining a RASCI matrix or similar documentation.
   - **Scope**: Explicitly state the entities and environments included in the policy, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
   - **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role involved, including action verbs and frequency. Ensure you link to related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Sanction Policy).

3. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - Use numbered subheadings: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:" for each requirement.
   - For **MACHINE ATTESTATION**, describe automatable methods for collecting evidence (e.g., "Collect the RASCI matrix document via API integration with Surveilr").
   - For **HUMAN ATTESTATION**, specify the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr (e.g., "The Compliance Officer must sign the RASCI matrix review report quarterly, with the signed report uploaded to Surveilr").

4. **Verification Criteria**: Define clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the policy.

5. **Operational Details**: Ensure all processes include **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Provide a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps with specific time-bound metrics (e.g., "Complete the RASCI matrix review within 30 days of each quarter").

6. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a section detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

7. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Mandate workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

8. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Ensure all enforced keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are explicitly **BOLD**.

9. **References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end. If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None". 

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance for every requirement.
