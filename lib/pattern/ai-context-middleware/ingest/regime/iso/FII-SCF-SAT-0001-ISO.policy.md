# Security Workforce Development and Awareness Policy

## 1. Introduction
In an increasingly complex threat landscape, the importance of security workforce development and awareness controls cannot be overstated. A well-informed and trained workforce is fundamental to safeguarding the organization's assets and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Security awareness initiatives foster a culture of security consciousness, empowering employees to recognize and respond to security threats effectively.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is fully committed to facilitating security workforce development and awareness by implementing comprehensive training programs and awareness initiatives. This commitment ensures that all workforce members possess the necessary knowledge and skills to uphold the organization's security posture and protect sensitive information.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all workforce members, including employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who interact with organizational systems. It encompasses cloud-hosted systems, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels utilized to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic Protected Health Information (**ePHI**).

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: The organization requires the implementation of security workforce development and awareness controls to ensure all members are informed of security risks and best practices.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Evidence collection will utilize APIs to validate training completion records and automatically ingest training logs into Surveilr for real-time reporting and compliance tracking.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Workforce members will sign acknowledgment forms confirming their understanding and compliance with training requirements. These forms will be documented within Surveilr for audit purposes.

- **Achievable**: Training materials are accessible and relevant to all roles.
- **Relevant**: Training covers current security threats and best practices.
- **Time-bound**: Training must be completed within 30 days of onboarding and biannually thereafter.

**KPIs/SLAs** will include training completion rates, incident response times, and the frequency of security incidents reported.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and submitted to the Compliance Officer for review. A formal exception request must include the rationale, the potential impact on security, and the duration of the exception.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Training records and evidence logs must be retained for a minimum of three years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness in addressing emerging security challenges.
