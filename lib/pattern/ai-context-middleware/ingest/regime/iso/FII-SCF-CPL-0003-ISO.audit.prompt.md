You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** ISO 27001:2022
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure managers regularly review the processes and documented procedures within their area of responsibility to adhere to appropriate cybersecurity & data protection policies, standards and other applicable requirements."
Control Code: FII-SCF-CPL-0003,
Control Question: Does the organization ensure managers regularly review the processes and documented procedures within their area of responsibility to adhere to appropriate cybersecurity & data protection policies, standards and other applicable requirements?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-CPL-0003
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy establishes the framework for ensuring that managers within the organization regularly review processes and documented procedures related to cybersecurity and data protection. Regular reviews are crucial for maintaining compliance with applicable policies, standards, and regulatory requirements, thereby safeguarding sensitive data against potential threats. The organization is committed to ensuring that all managers perform regular reviews of processes and documented procedures within their areas of responsibility. This commitment is essential for upholding the integrity of our cybersecurity framework and data protection strategies."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Automated reports on review activities generated quarterly, showing timestamps and responsible parties for each department. Signed review logs from department managers confirming their biannual reviews of processes. Evidence of review logs uploaded to Surveilr with associated metadata."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: ISO 27001:2022 - FII-SCF-CPL-0003

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**  
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]  
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., ISO Auditor]  
**Control Code:** FII-SCF-CPL-0003  
**Control Question:** Does the organization ensure managers regularly review the processes and documented procedures within their area of responsibility to adhere to appropriate cybersecurity & data protection policies, standards and other applicable requirements?  
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-CPL-0003  
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To ensure managers regularly review the processes and documented procedures within their area of responsibility to adhere to appropriate cybersecurity & data protection policies, standards and other applicable requirements.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Managers are required to regularly review processes and procedures to ensure compliance with cybersecurity and data protection policies.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated reports on review activities generated quarterly, showing timestamps and responsible parties for each department.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated report generation and logging through Surveilr's ingestion methods.
