You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Mechanisms exist to establish usage restrictions and implementation guidance for communications technologies based on the potential to cause damage to systems, if used maliciously." (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0005.3). 

## Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy and its importance in the context of human resources security and protecting organizational systems from malicious use of communications technologies.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on the acceptable use of communications technologies, emphasizing compliance with established restrictions and guidance.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, explicitly including all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

4. **Responsibilities**: Outline specific, task-level duties for each role involved in policy enforcement, including Compliance Officer and IT Security personnel, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Describe the requirement for establishing usage restrictions and guidance.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical methods for collecting evidence, such as configuration details from endpoint security tools, automatic logging of communications technologies usage, and web content filtering configuration.
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Provide detailed steps for human verification, such as managers reviewing and signing off on the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and maintaining logs of training sessions.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**. For example, ensure that all communications technologies are reviewed and approved at least quarterly.

7. **Exceptions**: Define the process for documenting exceptions to the policy, including justification and approval requirements.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **Final Section Requirements**: End the policy document with exactly ONE References section. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.
