1. **Introduction**  
In today's digital landscape, the secure management of critical systems, applications, and services is paramount for organizational resilience and integrity. Involving pertinent stakeholders ensures a collaborative approach that integrates diverse perspectives, enhances compliance, and mitigates risk. This policy outlines the framework for identifying and engaging stakeholders essential to the ongoing secure management of these assets.

2. **Policy Statement**  
The organization is committed to the proactive identification and involvement of relevant stakeholders in the management of critical systems, applications, and services. This commitment aims to foster a secure environment that supports continuous improvement and compliance with industry standards.

3. **Scope**  
This policy applies to all internal and external stakeholders involved with critical systems, applications, and services, including cloud-hosted systems and third-party vendor systems. All organizational units and personnel engaged in the management of these assets are covered under this policy.

6. **Verification Criteria**  
Compliance validation will be measured against specific **KPIs/SLAs**, including:

- Frequency of stakeholder meetings held (target: minimum of 4 meetings per year).  
- Timeliness of updates to stakeholder lists (target: 100% compliance within established frequencies).

7. **Exceptions**  
Any exceptions to this policy must be formally requested and documented. The process for requesting exceptions includes submitting a written justification to the Compliance Officer, who will review and maintain records of all exceptions approved or denied.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**  
- **Data Retention**: All evidence related to stakeholder involvement and management must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.  
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness, with updates made as necessary based on stakeholder feedback and changes in regulatory requirements.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**  
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy.
