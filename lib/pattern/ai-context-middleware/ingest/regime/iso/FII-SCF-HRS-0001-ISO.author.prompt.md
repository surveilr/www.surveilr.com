You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization facilitate the implementation of personnel security controls?" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0001).

## Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**: Describe the purpose of the policy and its importance in maintaining personnel security within the organization.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to implementing and maintaining personnel security controls.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy to include all relevant entities and environments, encompassing cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify the roles and their **Action Verb + Frequency** duties related to personnel security, ensuring clear accountability.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Outline the mechanisms for background checks, security training, and ongoing personnel monitoring.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence, such as automated ingestion of background check reports and access control records into Surveilr.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Describe specific actions like management reviewing and signing off on background check policies, with documentation uploaded to Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly linked to **SMART** **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions**: Detail the process for managing exceptions to the policy, including documentation requirements.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify the **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and establish a mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, along with comprehensive audit logging for critical actions and formal documentation for exceptions.

10. **References**: Include a list of external references, if applicable, or state "None" if there are no references.

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure that there are no References subsections within any policy sections. The document must end with exactly ONE References section. All enforced keywords must be **BOLD**: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. Failure to **BOLD** any keyword is a critical non-compliance error.
