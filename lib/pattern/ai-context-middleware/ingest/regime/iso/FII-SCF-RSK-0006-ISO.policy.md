# Risk Remediation Policy

## Introduction
In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving digital landscape, effective risk management and remediation are vital for the protection of organizational assets, particularly when handling sensitive information such as electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). This policy outlines our commitment to remediating risks to an acceptable level, ensuring compliance with relevant standards and frameworks, including ISO 27001:2022. By actively managing and remediating risks, the organization safeguards its reputation, enhances operational resilience, and complies with regulatory obligations.

## Policy Statement
The organization is dedicated to identifying, assessing, and remediating risks to an acceptable level. We commit to implementing a structured risk management process that includes regular assessments, the development of risk treatment plans, and ongoing monitoring to ensure that identified risks are addressed in a timely and effective manner.

## Scope
This policy applies to all relevant entities and environments within the organization, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)

- **Department Heads:** Ensure departmental compliance with risk remediation strategies **ongoingly**.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   A defined risk treatment plan is crucial for effective risk management as it provides a structured approach to addressing identified risks, ensuring that risks are mitigated to an acceptable level per organizational standards and compliance requirements.

   Utilize Surveilr to ingest risk treatment plan documentation, automatically track updates, and generate compliance reports. This automated method bolsters efficiency and accuracy in maintaining up-to-date records of risk management activities.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   The Risk Manager must certify the risk treatment plan **quarterly**, ensuring that the signed document is uploaded to Surveilr. This human action is essential for validating the effectiveness of the remediation efforts and maintaining transparency.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be based on the following SMART objectives and KPIs/SLAs:
- **Specific:** Ensure that 100% of identified risks have a corresponding risk treatment plan.
- **Measurable:** 95% of risk treatment plans are updated within 30 days of a risk assessment.
- **Achievable:** Achieve at least a 90% reduction in high-risk vulnerabilities through remediation efforts annually.
- **Relevant:** Align remediation activities with organizational risk tolerance levels.
- **Time-Bound:** Conduct risk assessments and updates to the risk treatment plan **monthly**.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented, including:
- Justification for the exception
- Duration of the exception

Documentation must be submitted to Surveilr for tracking and audit purposes.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** All evidence and logs related to risk remediation must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- **Policy Review and Update:** This policy must be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.
