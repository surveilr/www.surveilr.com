You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: FII-SCF-CPL-0002.1). 

## Instructions for Policy Authoring:

1. **Document Structure**: Follow the mandatory policy section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections.

2. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown elements including H2 headings (##), paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Ensure to use the format for showing Citation links as [Link Text](URL).

3. **Attestation Guidance**:
   - For **Machine Attestation**: Clearly describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection. For example, "Use OSquery to collect configuration details of internal audit logs weekly."
   - For **Human Attestation**: Define precise actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr. For instance, "The Compliance Officer must sign the quarterly internal audit report, and the signed report is uploaded to Surveilr with metadata (review date, reviewer name)."

4. **Operational Detail**: Provide **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions throughout the policy. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like audit findings review or remediation, along with a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

5. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems**, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit information.

6. **Granular Roles and Responsibilities**: The Responsibilities section must define specific duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery actions.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: The policy must require **workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, along with comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

9. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

10. **Keyword Emphasis**: Ensure to explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

11. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section** of the policy document, containing exactly ONE References section. Do NOT include control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content after this section.

### Evidence Collection Methods Format:
- Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

### End of Document:
Ensure that the policy document ends with the **References section**, and do not include any subsections within individual policy sections.

Your output must adhere strictly to these guidelines to ensure robustness and compliance with Surveilr-enabled machine attestability.
