You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: FII-SCF-PRM-0001). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure:

## Introduction
- Explain the purpose of the policy and its relevance to cybersecurity and data privacy objectives.

## Policy Statement
- Clearly state the organizationâ€™s commitment to implementing cybersecurity and data privacy-related resource planning controls.

## Scope
- Define the scope of the policy to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved in the implementation and oversight of this policy. Link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT: Describe the mechanisms that facilitate the implementation of cybersecurity and data privacy-related resource planning controls.
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence, such as using project management tools to track resource planning documents.
3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Detail the specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr, such as requiring a signed approval for project plans and budget allocations.

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

## Exceptions
- Outline the process for documenting exceptions to the policy, including justification, duration, and approval.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

### References
- Ensure to include a single References section at the end of the document. Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections. 

Emphasize throughout the policy that all instructions must follow the principles of **SMART**, include **KPIs/SLAs**, and utilize **Action Verb + Frequency** for responsibilities. Ensure that **Data Retention** and **Annual Review** are explicitly mentioned and **BOLD**ed. 

The policy document must conclude with exactly ONE References section.
