You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization define rules of behavior that contain explicit restrictions on the use of social media and networking sites, posting information on commercial websites and sharing account information?" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0005.2). 

**Policy Structure:**
1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's stance on social media use and restrictions.
3. **Scope**: Define the entities and environments covered, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
4. **Responsibilities**: Specify the roles and their corresponding task-level duties using **Action Verbs + Frequency**.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Describe how to collect evidence of compliance.
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: State the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Describe precise steps, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline processes for documenting any exceptions to the policy.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail data retention periods and mandatory policy review frequency (**Annual Review**).
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, along with comprehensive audit logging.
10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document, with no references in the individual policy sections.

**Formatting Guidelines:**
- Use H2 headings (##) for major sections.
- Incorporate standard Markdown elements such as paragraphs, bullet points, and bold text.
- Ensure that keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are **BOLD**.
- Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections; they should appear only at the very end of the document.

The policy must maximize machine attestability by providing concrete examples of automated evidence collection and clearly defined human actions where automation is impractical. Each policy section must include attestation guidance to ensure compliance.
