You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "Mechanisms exist to identify and document risks, both internal and external." (FII: FII-SCF-RSK-0003). 

The policy must adhere to the following structure and requirements:

## Introduction
- Provide a brief overview of the purpose of the policy related to risk identification and documentation.

## Policy Statement
- Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to identifying and documenting risks. 

## Scope
- Explicitly define the policy's scope, including all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties for each role involved in risk management, using **Action Verbs + Frequency** (e.g., "Risk Manager: quarterly risk assessment review").

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   - Describe the requirement for risk identification and documentation.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   - Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence (e.g., "Use Surveilr to pull data from the risk management system to validate risk documentation").
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   - Provide precise steps for human actions and required artifacts (e.g., "The Risk Manager must sign the risk assessment report, which is then uploaded to Surveilr with metadata including review date and reviewer name").

## Verification Criteria
- Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **SMART** metrics and **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection section.

## Exceptions
- Outline any exceptions to the policy and the procedure for documenting these exceptions.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Specify minimum **Data Retention** periods for risk management evidence (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

### References
- Include any applicable external references in the format [Link Text](URL). If no external references exist, state "None".

Ensure that the policy document strictly follows the order of sections outlined above, does not include References subsections within individual policy sections, and ends with exactly ONE References section. Remember to **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the policy.
