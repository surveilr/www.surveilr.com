You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : (FII: FII-SCF-CPL-0003).

## Policy Structure
1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and relevance to cybersecurity and data protection.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to ensuring managers regularly review processes and documented procedures.
3. **Scope**: Define the scope of this policy, including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in the review process (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval; IT Security: monthly procedure review).
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement for managers to regularly review processes and procedures.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using version control to track changes in documents and generating reports on review activities.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify the actions that managers must take to document their reviews, including signing review logs and uploading them to Surveilr with metadata.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs**, such as ensuring that review logs are updated monthly and audits are conducted quarterly.
7. **Exceptions**: Describe any exceptions to the policy along with the process for documenting and approving these exceptions.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Outline minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence and the mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging of critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
10. **References**: This section should appear only at the very end of the document. Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections.

Ensure that all policy sections follow the specified order and that the policy maximizes machine attestability, with detailed attestation guidance included throughout. **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

The document must conclude with a single **References** section, listing any external references used in the policy.
