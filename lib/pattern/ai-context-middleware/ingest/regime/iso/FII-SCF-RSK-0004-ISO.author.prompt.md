You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: FII-SCF-RSK-0004 (FII: ). 

The policy document must follow this structure: **Introduction**, **Policy Statement**, **Scope**, **Responsibilities**, **Evidence Collection Methods**, **Verification Criteria**, **Exceptions**, **Lifecycle Requirements**, **Formal Documentation and Audit**, and **References**. Ensure that the policy includes the following:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly describe the purpose of the policy and its significance in the context of risk management.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to conducting recurring assessments of risk regarding unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of its systems and data.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope explicitly, covering all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data.

4. **Responsibilities**: Assign specific task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for roles involved in the risk assessment process. Link to related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan).

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - Use numbered subheadings:
     1. **REQUIREMENT**: Describe the specific requirement for conducting recurring risk assessments.
     2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automatable methods to collect and validate evidence (e.g., integrating with risk management tools, collecting risk assessment reports).
     3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr for any non-automatable evidence (e.g., signed risk assessment reports).

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **KPIs/SLAs**, associated with the risk assessment process.

7. **Exceptions**: Describe any exceptions to the policy, including the process for documenting and approving these exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum data retention periods for risk assessment evidence (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and updates (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions (justification, duration, approval).

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes detailed attestation guidance for each requirement, and addresses every rule in the "Requirements for the Policy Document" section. Do not include References subsections within policy sections; the References section should only appear at the very end of the document. Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. The final section must contain exactly ONE References section.
