You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "Does the organization ensure that all security-related positions are staffed by qualified individuals who have the necessary skill set?" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0003.2). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Each section should follow these guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: Use H2 headings (##) per major requirement. Each section must explain the control requirement, suggest machine attestation methods, and suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable. Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections. 

2. **Markdown Elements**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Use the format for Citation links: [Link Text](URL).

3. **Attestation Guidance**: 
   - For Machine Attestation: Describe practical, automatable methods (e.g., "Collect job description data and security training records via API integrations with HR systems").
   - For Human Attestation: Describe precise steps and artifacts (e.g., "HR must maintain signed training records and upload them to Surveilr with metadata").

4. **Critical Requirements**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like hiring and training with specific time-bound metrics (e.g., "complete background checks within 7 days").

5. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels** for creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting security-related information.

6. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

7. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when human attestation is necessary.

8. **Granular Roles and Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned in the Responsibilities section, linking to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing **minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

11. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods, not writing SQL queries or code blocks.

12. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

13. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

14. **Markdown Formatting**: Standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

15. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

16. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section** is the final section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else.

17. **References Section Format**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

Ensure that the policy text explicitly uses and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. Failure to BOLD any keyword is a critical non-compliance error. 

The policy document must end with exactly ONE References section. Do not include References subsections after each policy section.
