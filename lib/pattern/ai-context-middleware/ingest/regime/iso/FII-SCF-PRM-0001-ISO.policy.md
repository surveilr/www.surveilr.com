# ISO Compliant Policy Document for Control: FII-SCF-PRM-0001

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the implementation of cybersecurity and data privacy-related resource planning controls within the organization. This policy is relevant to our cybersecurity and data privacy objectives as it ensures that adequate resources, protocols, and processes are in place to protect electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) from unauthorized access and breaches. By defining clear guidelines for the planning and allocation of resources, this policy will enhance our resilience against potential cybersecurity threats and demonstrate our commitment to safeguarding sensitive data.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to implementing effective cybersecurity and data privacy-related resource planning controls. We recognize the critical importance of resource planning in achieving our cybersecurity and data privacy objectives and will ensure that all relevant entities and environments adhere to this policy.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software as a Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## Responsibilities
- **Cybersecurity Officer**: Conduct quarterly assessments of resource planning controls to ensure compliance with the policy and report findings to the Executive Management.
- **IT Department**: Implement resource planning controls in all IT projects and ensure documentation is maintained and accessible within one week of project initiation.
- **Compliance Manager**: Review and update resource planning documentation annually to reflect any changes in regulations or organizational priorities.
- **Project Managers**: Ensure that all project plans and budget allocations are submitted for approval at least one month before project commencement.
- **HR Department**: Develop and maintain a Workforce Development Plan that aligns with cybersecurity and data privacy objectives, reviewed bi-annually.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Mechanisms such as project management tools, documentation templates, and reporting frameworks will facilitate the implementation of cybersecurity and data privacy-related resource planning controls.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automatable methods include using project management software to track resource planning documents, monitor project timelines, and assess budget allocations against objectives.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Project plans and budget allocations must be accompanied by a signed approval from the designated authority, which will be ingested into Surveilr for compliance tracking.

## Verification Criteria
The organization will validate compliance with this policy using the following measurable criteria:
- Completion rate of project plans submitted for approval (Target: 100% compliance)
- Timeliness of quarterly assessments conducted by the Cybersecurity Officer (Target: 100% on-time completion)
- Frequency of audits on resource planning controls (Target: Conducted bi-annually)

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented in writing, including the justification, duration of the exception, and the approval from the Compliance Manager. These exceptions will be reviewed during the annual policy review.

## Lifecycle Requirements
All evidence and logs related to resource planning controls must be retained for **at least 6 years**. This policy will be reviewed and updated **at least annually** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding of this policy upon employment and annually thereafter. Comprehensive audit logging will be implemented for all critical actions related to resource planning, and formal documentation will be maintained for all exceptions.
