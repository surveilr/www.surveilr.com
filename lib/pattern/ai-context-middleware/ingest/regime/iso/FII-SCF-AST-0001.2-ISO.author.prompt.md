You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization identify and involve pertinent stakeholders of critical systems, applications and services to support the ongoing secure management of those assets?" (FII: FII-SCF-AST-0001.2).

## Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the importance of stakeholder involvement in managing critical systems, applications, and services.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to identifying and involving stakeholders for secure asset management.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy to include all relevant internal and external stakeholders, critical systems, applications, and services, including cloud-hosted systems and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Outline specific, task-level duties using **Action Verbs + Frequency** for each role involved (e.g., Compliance Officer: quarterly review of stakeholder involvement documentation).

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use the following structure for each requirement:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the need to identify and involve stakeholders.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest methods for automated evidence collection, such as maintaining an up-to-date list of stakeholders in a centralized system (e.g., Surveilr).
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define the human actions needed, such as documenting stakeholder meetings and approvals, and how these will be uploaded to Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

7. **Exceptions**: Detail any exceptions to the policy, including the process for requesting and documenting them.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Data Retention** periods for evidence (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the **Annual Review** frequency for policy updates.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions. Document all exceptions formally.

10. **References**: The References section is the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes SMART instructions, and explicitly uses and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. Failure to include any of these keywords in bold will result in a critical non-compliance error.
