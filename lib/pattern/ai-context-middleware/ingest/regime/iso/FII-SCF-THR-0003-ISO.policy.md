# Policy Document for Control: FII-SCF-THR-0003

## 1. Introduction
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, maintaining situational awareness of vulnerabilities and emerging threats is paramount to safeguarding organizational assets. The dynamic nature of cyber threats necessitates proactive monitoring and analysis to protect sensitive information and ensure business continuity. Organizations must remain vigilant and informed about the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by potential adversaries to effectively defend against these threats.

## 2. Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to leveraging comprehensive knowledge of attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures to enhance our threat management strategies. By integrating threat intelligence into our operational processes, we aim to bolster our defenses, minimize risk, and ensure a resilient security posture. This commitment is essential for preventing and mitigating potential security incidents.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to cloud-hosted systems, Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, and third-party vendor systems. It encompasses all personnel involved in threat management, including Threat Intelligence Analysts, IT Security teams, and management, ensuring a holistic approach to situational awareness across the organization.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Threat Intelligence Analyst**: Responsible for daily monitoring of threat intelligence feeds and producing actionable insights. They must also prepare monthly reports detailing the review of subscriptions.
- **IT Security Team**: Tasked with the weekly review of threat modeling documentation and ensuring the integration of threat intelligence into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. They are also responsible for configuring alerts based on emerging threats.
- **Management**: Required to support and enforce compliance with this policy by allocating necessary resources and promoting a culture of security awareness.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: To maintain situational awareness, mechanisms must exist to collect and analyze data concerning vulnerabilities and evolving threats. This ensures that the organization can respond appropriately to changes in the threat landscape.
   
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Practical methods for collecting evidence include the integration of threat intelligence feeds into SIEM systems, configuring alerts for suspicious activities, and maintaining dashboards that visualize threat intelligence data. These automated processes enhance the efficiency and accuracy of threat monitoring.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Verifiable actions for human oversight include a signed report from the Threat Intelligence Analyst certifying the monthly review of threat intelligence subscriptions and documenting any significant findings or changes in threat landscapes.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be measured against defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Specific criteria include:
- The timely integration of threat intelligence feeds into SIEM systems (within 48 hours of acquisition).
- Monthly reports from Threat Intelligence Analysts confirming review completion and insights derived.
- Audit logs indicating successful configuration of alerts on a weekly basis.

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented through a formal request process. The request should outline the rationale for the exception, the risks involved, and any compensating controls in place. Approval must be obtained from the IT Security management team, and records of exceptions must be maintained for auditing purposes.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
Evidence related to threat intelligence and situational awareness must be retained for a minimum of three years. Additionally, this policy will be reviewed and updated annually to ensure its relevance and effectiveness in addressing emerging threats and organizational changes.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding of and compliance with this policy through formal documentation. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained to track compliance efforts, and all exceptions must be formally documented and retained for review.
