You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Mechanisms exist to coordinate cybersecurity, data protection and business alignment through a steering committee or advisory board, comprised of key cybersecurity, data privacy and business executives, which meets formally and on a regular basis." (FII: FII-SCF-GOV-0001.1).

## Policy Structure
1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the importance of coordinating cybersecurity, data protection, and business alignment through a formal steering committee or advisory board.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the commitment to establish and maintain a steering committee or advisory board for these purposes.
3. **Scope**: Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
4. **Responsibilities**: Assign specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved, such as cybersecurity officers and data privacy officers. Explicitly link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the mechanisms for coordination.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Specify how evidence will be collected (e.g., "Use Surveilr to store meeting minutes and attendance records").
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Define the actions a human must perform, such as signing off on meeting minutes or maintaining a list of committee members.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **SMART** objectives and **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for documenting them.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Specify the **Data Retention** periods for evidence and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (**Annual Review**).
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation of exceptions.
10. **References**: Include a single References section at the end of the document, without any References subsections in individual policy sections.

Ensure that all policy sections maximize machine attestability with explicit attestation guidance. Use **bold** text for the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. The document must end with exactly ONE References section. Do not include any SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code in the policy document.
