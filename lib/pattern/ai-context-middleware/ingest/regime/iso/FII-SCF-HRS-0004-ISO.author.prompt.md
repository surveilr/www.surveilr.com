You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization manage personnel security risk by screening individuals prior to authorizing access?" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0004). 

### Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**: Clearly define the purpose and importance of managing personnel security risk through screening prior to access authorization.

2. **Policy Statement**: Articulate the organization's commitment to screening individuals and the principles guiding this policy.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to cover all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

4. **Responsibilities**: 
   - Define specific, task-level duties for each role involved in the screening process using **Action Verb + Frequency** format (e.g., "HR Manager: conduct background checks for new hires prior to access approval").
   - Link to related organizational plans such as the Incident Response Plan or Sanction Policy.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the control requirement related to personnel security risk management.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automatable methods for collecting evidence, such as using API integrations with background check services to validate screening completion.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Outline the specific actions and documentation required, such as maintaining signed background check records uploaded to Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

7. **Exceptions**: State the process for documenting exceptions, including justification, duration, and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Data Retention** periods for screening records and the mandatory frequency of **Annual Review** for the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

### Attestation Guidance

- Ensure that for each policy section, the AI provides concrete examples of automated evidence collection and human attestation methods, emphasizing the need for machine attestability.

### Final Section Requirements

- The document must conclude with exactly ONE References section. Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections. 

### Markdown Formatting

- Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. Ensure that the following keywords are **BOLD**: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

### References Section Format

- If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None". 

Ensure clarity, robustness, and machine attestability throughout the policy content.
