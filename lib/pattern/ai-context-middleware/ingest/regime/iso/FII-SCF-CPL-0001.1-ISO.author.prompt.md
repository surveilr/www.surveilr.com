You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: FII-SCF-CPL-0001.1). The policy must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** for processes like containment, correction, or **violation sanction**, along with a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to cover **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels** used for creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting ePHI.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide examples of automated evidence collection/validation methods.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Where automation is impractical, define the exact action, artifact, and how it will be ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section must define specific duties for each role mentioned, using **Action Verbs + Frequency** and explicitly linking to or referencing related organizational plans.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Data Retention periods** for evidence/logs and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require **Workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

9. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Structure must include numbered subheadings: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

10. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

11. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

12. **Hyperlinks**: Format external references using [Link Text](URL).

13. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end. No References subsections should appear within individual policy sections.

14. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

15. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document**. After this section, output nothing else.

The policy must document and review instances of non-compliance with statutory, regulatory, and/or contractual obligations to develop appropriate risk mitigation actions. Include mechanisms for documenting compliance audit and gap analysis reports, logs of non-compliance incidents, and updates to the risk register.
