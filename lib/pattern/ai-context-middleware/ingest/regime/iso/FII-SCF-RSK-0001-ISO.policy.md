# Risk Management Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this Risk Management Policy is to establish a structured framework for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks that may affect the organizationâ€™s ability to achieve its strategic, operational, and tactical objectives. Effective risk management is crucial for safeguarding organizational assets, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and maintaining the trust of stakeholders. By implementing this policy, the organization underscores its commitment to proactive risk management and continuous improvement in risk mitigation practices.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to implementing effective risk management controls across all levels of operation. We will strive to identify potential risks, assess their impact, and employ strategic, operational, and tactical measures to manage those risks in alignment with our organizational goals.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
