# ISO Policy Document for Control: FII-SCF-RSK-0004

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the recurring assessment of risks associated with unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the organization's systems and data. This policy is significant in the context of risk management as it helps protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of sensitive information, ensuring compliance with applicable regulations and standards.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to conducting recurring assessments of risk to evaluate the likelihood and magnitude of harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of its systems and data. These assessments will be integral to our risk management strategy and will help mitigate potential threats and vulnerabilities.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- On-premises systems
- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive data

## Responsibilities
- **Risk Management Team**: Conduct risk assessments **quarterly** and report findings to senior management.
- **IT Security Team**: Monitor and update security controls **monthly** to align with identified risks.
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and ensure policy compliance **annually** and facilitate training.
- **Incident Response Team**: Coordinate with the Risk Management Team in the event of unauthorized access incidents **as needed**.
- **Disaster Recovery Team**: Integrate risk assessment findings into the Disaster Recovery Plan **biannually**.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Conduct recurring risk assessments at least **quarterly** to evaluate potential risks associated with unauthorized activities.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automate evidence collection by integrating with risk management tools to collect and validate risk assessment reports, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: For non-automatable evidence, require signed risk assessment reports to be uploaded into Surveilr, including documentation of the assessment process and findings.

## Verification Criteria
- Compliance will be validated through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as:
  - Percentage of completed risk assessments within the designated timeframe (target: 100% quarterly).
  - Number of identified risks mitigated within the reporting period (target: 90%).
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs) will ensure that risk assessment reports are generated and reviewed within **30 days** of completion.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. The exception documentation must include:
- Justification for the exception
- Duration of the exception
- Approval signatures from relevant stakeholders

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Risk assessment evidence must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained for all critical actions related to risk assessments, and formal documentation for any exceptions will be required, including justification, duration, and approval.
