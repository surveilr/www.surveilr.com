- Detail **Responsibilities** by defining specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in risk management.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT: Identify assumptions, constraints, risk tolerance, and management priorities.  
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Describe methods for automated evidence collection, such as using risk assessment templates and documenting risk methodologies in Surveilr.  
3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Specify actions such as obtaining managerial sign-off on risk treatment plans and maintaining logs of risk acceptance criteria.

## Verification Criteria
