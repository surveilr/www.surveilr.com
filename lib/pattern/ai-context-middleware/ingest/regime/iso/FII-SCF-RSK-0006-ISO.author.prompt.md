You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization remediate risks to an acceptable level?" (FII: FII-SCF-RSK-0006).

## Introduction
- Provide an overview of the importance of risk remediation within the organization and its alignment with compliance standards.

## Policy Statement
- Clearly state the organizationâ€™s commitment to remediating risks to an acceptable level.

## Scope
- Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments: cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- Outline specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for roles involved in risk remediation, such as:
  - Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval.
  - Risk Management Team: monthly risk assessment reviews.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT:
   - Explain the need for a defined risk treatment plan as part of the risk management policy.
   
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - Describe how to collect evidence of risk treatment plans using automated methods (e.g., "Utilize Surveilr to ingest risk treatment plan documentation and track updates").
   
3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - Specify the human actions required, such as "The Risk Manager must certify the risk treatment plan quarterly, with the signed document uploaded to Surveilr."

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to **SMART** objectives and **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the policy.

## Exceptions
- Detail processes for documenting exceptions, including justification, duration, and approval.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Define **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs (e.g., retain for 6 years) and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., reviewed at least **annually**).

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
