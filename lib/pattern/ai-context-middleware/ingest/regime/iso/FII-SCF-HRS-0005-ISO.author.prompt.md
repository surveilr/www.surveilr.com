You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0005). 

Please follow these instructions to create a comprehensive policy:

1. **Document Structure**: Organize the policy into the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

2. **Policy Sections**: Each section should be clearly defined using H2 headings (##) and must include the following:
   - Explain the control requirement.
   - Suggest machine attestation methods to maximize automation (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
   - Suggest human attestation methods for scenarios where automation is impractical (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report"). 
   - **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections. The References section should appear ONLY at the end of the document.

3. **Attestation Guidance**: 
   - For **Machine Attestation**: Describe practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence.
   - For **Human Attestation**: Specify the exact action, artifact, and method for ingestion into Surveilr.

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Use **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment or correction, along with specific time-bound metrics (KPIs/SLA).

5. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Clearly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

6. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection and validation for each requirement.

7. **Explicit Human Attestation**: When necessary, define the action, artifact, and ingestion method for human attestation.

8. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: In the Responsibilities section, define specific duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role and explicitly link to related organizational plans for escalation and corrective actions.

9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

11. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Structure this section using numbered subheadings: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

12. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied directly to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

13. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

14. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

15. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section must be the last section of the policy document**. After this section, do not output anything else. 

16. **References Section Format**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

17. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text **MUST** explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. Failure to BOLD any keyword is a critical non-compliance error.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and contains detailed attestation methods for each requirement. The final document should end with a single References section.
