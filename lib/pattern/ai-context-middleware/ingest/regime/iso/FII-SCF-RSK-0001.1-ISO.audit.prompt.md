You're an **official auditor (e.g., ISO Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** ISO 27001:2022
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization identifies assumptions affecting risk assessments, risk response and risk monitoring; constraints affecting risk assessments, risk response and risk monitoring; the organizational risk tolerance; and priorities, benefits and trade-offs considered by the organization for managing risk."
  * **Control Code:** FII-SCF-RSK-0001.1
  * **Control Question:** Does the organization identify: (1) Assumptions affecting risk assessments, risk response and risk monitoring; (2) Constraints affecting risk assessments, risk response and risk monitoring; (3) The organizational risk tolerance; and (4) Priorities, benefits and trade-offs considered by the organization for managing risk?
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-RSK-0001.1
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to establish a structured approach to identifying assumptions, constraints, risk tolerance, and management priorities related to risk assessments, risk response, and risk monitoring within the organization. This policy is designed to ensure that all relevant parties understand their roles and responsibilities in managing risk effectively, thereby enhancing the organization's overall risk management framework in compliance with ISO 27001:2022 standards."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Evidence includes risk assessment templates, documentation of assumptions and constraints from the last quarterly review, managerial sign-offs on risk treatment plans, and logs of risk acceptance criteria maintained in Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: ISO 27001:2022 - FII-SCF-RSK-0001.1

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [ISO Auditor]
**Control Code:** [FII-SCF-RSK-0001.1]
**Control Question:** [Does the organization identify: (1) Assumptions affecting risk assessments, risk response and risk monitoring; (2) Constraints affecting risk assessments, risk response and risk monitoring; (3) The organizational risk tolerance; and (4) Priorities, benefits and trade-offs considered by the organization for managing risk?]
**Internal ID (FII):** [FII-SCF-RSK-0001.1]
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** [The organization identifies assumptions affecting risk assessments, risk response and risk monitoring; constraints affecting risk assessments, risk response and risk monitoring; the organizational risk tolerance; and priorities, benefits and trade-offs considered by the organization for managing risk.]

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Identify assumptions, constraints, risk tolerance, and management priorities through structured discussions and documentation.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Risk assessment templates and documentation of assumptions and constraints from the last quarterly review.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated collection and documentation within Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM risk_assessment WHERE quarter = '2025-Q2';
    * **Compliance Status:** [COMPLIANT / NON-COMPLIANT / INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE]
    * **Justification:** [Detailed explanation of why the evidence is compliant, non-compliant, or insufficient, directly correlating the *provided evidence* to the *control requirement*. If non-compliant, specify the exact deviation.]

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Managerial sign-offs on risk treatment plans.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Logs of risk acceptance criteria maintained in Surveilr showing timely approvals.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Evidence of signed risk treatment plans stored in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** [COMPLIANT / NON-COMPLIANT / INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE]
    * **Justification:** [Detailed explanation of compliance or non-compliance.]

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Managerial sign-off on risk treatment plans.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Documentation showing managerial approvals for the last four risk treatment plans.

    * **Justification:** [Detailed explanation of compliance or non-compliance.]

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** [Based on the totality of the provided evidence, does it genuinely demonstrate that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice?]
* **Justification:** [Explain why or why not, considering the broader objectives of the control beyond just literal checklist items.]
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** [If certain evidence is present but still fails to meet the *spirit* of the control, explain this with specific examples from the evidence.]

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** [Reiterate the "PASS" or "FAIL" decision, which must be based *solely* on the provided evidence's direct compliance with the control requirements and intent.]
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** [Provide a concise but comprehensive justification for the final decision, summarizing the most critical points of compliance or non-compliance identified during the evidence assessment.]

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
