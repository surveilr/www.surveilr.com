# ISO Control Policy for FII-SCF-GOV-0008

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish mechanisms that define the context of the organization's business model and document its mission. This policy aligns with the ISO 27001:2022 framework, specifically focusing on Cybersecurity & Data Protection Governance. 

## Policy Statement
The organization shall develop and maintain a comprehensive document outlining the context of its business model and articulate its mission. This document will serve as a foundational element for the Information Security Management System (ISMS) and will ensure that all stakeholders understand the organizational objectives and the strategic importance of cybersecurity within the business context.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who interact with the organization's information systems. It encompasses:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)

## Responsibilities
- **Executive Management**: Responsible for approving the context document and ensuring alignment with organizational goals.
- **Information Security Officer (ISO)**: Tasked with overseeing the creation and maintenance of the context document.
- **Compliance Team**: Responsible for conducting regular reviews to ensure the document reflects the current business model and mission.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**: Document outlining the context and mission of the organization.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
   - Automated tools will generate reports from the content management system (CMS) that track changes and version history of the context document.
   - Implement a digital signature mechanism that records all approvals in a secure log.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
   - Key stakeholders must sign a physical or digital acknowledgment of the document upon its initial release and at each **Annual Review**.
   - The signed acknowledgments will be submitted to Surveilr for ingestion and audit purposes.

## Verification Criteria
- The context document must be reviewed and updated at least annually.
- Compliance with the policy will be assessed through audits, ensuring that at least 95% of relevant stakeholders have acknowledged the document.
- The document must clearly articulate the business model and mission, with a documented approval trail.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and approved by the Executive Management. These exceptions will be reviewed during the **Annual Review** process to ensure they remain valid.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: The context document and all related evidence must be retained for a minimum of five years.
- **Annual Review**: The document must undergo a review at least once a year to ensure its relevance and accuracy.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be implemented for all critical actions related to the context document, including its creation, modification, and approval processes. Any exceptions must be documented formally.
