You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : (FII: FII-SCF-OPS-0003). 

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections; the References section must be the final section of the document. 

2. **Policy Requirements**: 
   - **Introduction**: Outline the purpose and importance of defining supporting business processes and implementing governance and service management.
   - **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to adhering to industry-recognized standards for technology capabilities.
   - **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's scope, covering all relevant entities, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
   - **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role involved in policy enforcement.

3. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - For each requirement, provide:
     - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement in detail.
     - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence validation, such as using OSquery to collect endpoint configuration and software details.
     - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Describe the specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr for human evidence.

4. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

5. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **SMART** instructions, including a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment and correction, along with specific time-bound metrics (e.g., “contain within 48 hours”).

6. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

7. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

8. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code. Emphasize keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** in bold.

9. **Final Section Requirements**: Ensure that the **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document**. If external references exist, list them using the format [Link Text](URL). If no external references exist, state "None" in the References section.

By following these instructions, you will create a comprehensive policy document that maximizes machine attestability and ensures compliance with the specified control requirements.
