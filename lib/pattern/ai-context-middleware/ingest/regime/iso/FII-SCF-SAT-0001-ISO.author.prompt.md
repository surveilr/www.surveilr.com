You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization facilitate the implementation of security workforce development and awareness controls?" (FII: FII-SCF-SAT-0001). 

The policy document must follow this structure without including References subsections in each section and must end with exactly ONE References section. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the importance of security workforce development and awareness controls.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to facilitating security workforce development and awareness.

3. **Scope**: Define the explicit scope, covering all relevant entities, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties for each role involved, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format (e.g., "Compliance Officer: quarterly policy approval").

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the requirement for security workforce development and awareness controls.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest automatable methods for evidence collection, such as using APIs to validate training completion records or ingesting training logs into Surveilr.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify the necessary human actions, artifacts, and how they will be documented within Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **SMART** guidelines and **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for handling exceptions to the policy.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, along with comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.

10. **References**: Conclude the document with a single References section listing any external references using the format [Link Text](URL) or state "None" if there are no external references.

Ensure the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes operational detail and specificity, and uses bold text for the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.
