You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization verify that individuals accessing a system processing, storing, or transmitting sensitive information are formally indoctrinated for all the relevant types of information to which they have access on the system?" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0004.2).

Please structure the policy document as follows:

## Introduction
- Clearly explain the purpose of the policy regarding access to sensitive information and the importance of formal indoctrination.

## Policy Statement
- Define the organization's commitment to ensuring all individuals accessing sensitive information are formally trained.

## Scope
- Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved in the policy enforcement, explicitly linking to or referencing related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT:
   - State the requirement for formal indoctrination of individuals accessing sensitive information.
   
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - Suggest practical, automatable methods to verify training completion, such as using learning management systems to track training records.

3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - Describe the specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr, such as maintaining signed training completion logs by HR.

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the defined KPIs/SLAs.

## Exceptions
- Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the justification, duration, and approval processes.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

### References
- List any external references used in the policy document using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, state "None."

**IMPORTANT:** Exclude any References subsections within individual policy sections. The policy document must end with exactly ONE References section.
