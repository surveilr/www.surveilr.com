You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "" (FII: FII-SCF-SAT-0002). 

## Policy Document Structure
1. **Introduction**: Introduce the purpose of the policy and its importance in ensuring that all employees and contractors receive appropriate awareness education and training relevant to their job functions.
   
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to providing necessary training and awareness programs for all employees and contractors.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope to include all employees, contractors, and relevant third-party personnel, covering all job functions and roles across the organization.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the implementation and oversight of training programs. Use **Action Verb + Frequency** for clarity (e.g., "Compliance Officer: quarterly review of training materials").

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the mechanisms for providing appropriate training.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest using automated systems to track training completion through Learning Management Systems (LMS) or similar platforms.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Indicate that training attendance records must be signed off by supervisors and uploaded to Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for validating compliance with the training requirements. Link these criteria to the defined **KPIs/SLAs** (e.g., "100% of employees must complete role-specific training within 30 days of hire").

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, how they should be documented, and the approval process for such exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Define **Data Retention** periods for training records (e.g., "retain training records for 6 years") and the **Annual Review** frequency of the training programs.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, and mandate comprehensive audit logging for training completion and compliance verification. Include a process for documenting exceptions.

10. **References**: This section appears ONLY at the end of the document and should include external references as needed.

### Important Instructions
- Ensure that all sections are formatted using standard Markdown elements, including headings, bullet points, and bold text for emphasis.
- Do not include References subsections within policy sections; the References section must be the final section of the document.
- Ensure the document adheres strictly to the provided guidelines to achieve a 100% compliance score. Include **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** in bold text as required.
- The final output must have only one References section at the end, with no control identifiers, metadata, or additional content following it. 

### References Section Format
- If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format.
- If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".
