You're an **official auditor (e.g., ISO Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** ISO 27001:2022
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization implements an internal audit function that is capable of providing senior organization management with insights into the appropriateness of its technology and information governance processes."
    - Control Code: FII-SCF-CPL-0002.1
    - Control Question: Does the organization implement an internal audit function that is capable of providing senior organization management with insights into the appropriateness of its technology and information governance processes?
    - Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-CPL-0002.1
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy outlines the mechanisms for implementing an internal audit function capable of providing senior management with insights into the appropriateness of the organization's technology and information governance processes. The policy aims to ensure compliance with ISO 27001:2022 standards, specifically focusing on the Compliance domain. The organization commits to establishing and maintaining an effective internal audit function that regularly assesses technology and information governance processes, ensuring they align with both regulatory requirements and organizational objectives."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "The internal audit function utilizes OSquery to collect system configuration details and logs related to internal audits weekly. Quarterly audit reports are submitted to senior management, and the Compliance Officer signs the quarterly internal audit report, which is uploaded to Surveilr with metadata (review date, reviewer name) within one week of completion."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report  (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: ISO 27001:2022 - FII-SCF-CPL-0002.1

**Overall Audit Result:** [PASS/FAIL]
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., ISO Auditor]
**Control Code:** FII-SCF-CPL-0002.1
**Control Question:** Does the organization implement an internal audit function that is capable of providing senior organization management with insights into the appropriateness of its technology and information governance processes?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-CPL-0002.1
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization implements an internal audit function that is capable of providing senior organization management with insights into the appropriateness of its technology and information governance processes.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Establish an internal audit function that assesses technology and information governance.
    * **Provided Evidence:** The internal audit function utilizes OSquery to collect system configuration details and logs related to internal audits weekly.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery for collecting system configuration details and logs.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE compliance_status = 'active';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence shows regular collection of necessary data to support the internal audit function, complying with the control requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Quarterly audit reports submitted to senior management.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Quarterly audit reports are submitted to senior management.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated report generation from internal systems.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM audit_reports WHERE submission_status = 'submitted';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence indicates that audit reports are being generated and submitted as required, demonstrating adherence to the control.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Compliance Officer's signed quarterly internal audit report.
    * **Provided Evidence:** The Compliance Officer signs the quarterly internal audit report, which is uploaded to Surveilr with metadata.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Compliance Officer's manual signing of the report.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The signed report is uploaded to Surveilr with relevant metadata.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed report serves as valid human attestation, meeting the control's requirement for documentation of the internal audit function.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent  Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the organization has established an effective internal audit function, which aligns with the underlying purpose and intent of the control.
* **Justification:** The evidence collectively confirms that the audit function is not only in place but actively operational, fulfilling both the letter and spirit of the control requirements.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and  Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The organization has successfully implemented an internal audit function that meets the requirements of the ISO 27001:2022 standard. All evidence provided demonstrates compliance with the control's expectations and the underlying intent.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [For example: "Missing current quarterly audit report signed by the Compliance Officer for Q2 2025."]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [For example: "The latest audit report did not include the necessary compliance findings; ensure that the audit report is revised to include all compliance issues identified."]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [For example: "Engage the Compliance Officer to sign and upload the latest quarterly audit report."]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [Outline the process for re-submission of the corrected/missing evidence for re-evaluation.]
