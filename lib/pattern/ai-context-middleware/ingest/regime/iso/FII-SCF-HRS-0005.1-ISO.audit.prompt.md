You're an **official auditor (e.g., ISO Auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** ISO 27001:2022
** Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To define acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technologies, including consequences for unacceptable behavior."
Control Code: [ISO-AC-001]
Control Question: "Does the organization define acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technologies, including consequences for unacceptable behavior?"
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-HRS-0005.1
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The purpose of this policy is to define the acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technology within the organization. By establishing clear guidelines, we aim to ensure a secure and efficient technology environment that protects our assets, data, and the integrity of our operations. This policy serves as a framework for promoting responsible use of technology and outlines the consequences of non-compliance."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "1. A report showing that 97% of the workforce members have completed the annual compliance acknowledgment. 2. A table of monitored user activities with three recorded violations in the last quarter. 3. A scanned copy of the signed compliance acknowledgment forms from workforce members, stored in Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: ISO 27001:2022 - [ISO-AC-001]

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., ISO Auditor]
**Control Code:** [ISO-AC-001]
**Control Question:** [Does the organization define acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technologies, including consequences for unacceptable behavior?]
**Internal ID (FII):** [FII-SCF-HRS-0005.1]
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** [To define acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technologies, including consequences for unacceptable behavior.]

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Mechanisms exist to define acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technologies.
    * **Provided Evidence:** A report showing that 97% of the workforce members have completed the annual compliance acknowledgment.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated tools such as OSquery for monitoring user activity.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM compliance_acknowledgments WHERE acknowledgment_date >= '2025-01-01' AND acknowledgment_date <= '2025-12-31';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence indicates that the majority of workforce members have acknowledged the acceptable use policy, meeting the expected evidence criteria.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Number of reported violations per quarter should be fewer than 5%.
    * **Provided Evidence:** A table of monitored user activities with three recorded violations in the last quarter.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Utilization of API integrations to capture real-time usage patterns and violations.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_activity_logs WHERE violation_flag = TRUE AND log_date >= '2025-04-01' AND log_date <= '2025-06-30';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The number of reported violations is well within the acceptable limits set by the control.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Workforce members should sign a compliance acknowledgment form upon policy distribution.
    * **Provided Evidence:** A scanned copy of the signed compliance acknowledgment forms from workforce members, stored in Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** All workforce members provided signed acknowledgment forms.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The signed forms are stored in Surveilr for future reference.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence shows that there is a documented process for human attestation, and all required forms are accounted for.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence effectively demonstrates that the organization has established and communicated acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for technology use.
* **Justification:** The evidence aligns with the overall intent of the control to promote responsible use of technology and outlines consequences for non-compliance.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None identified.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The evidence provided meets all machine and human attestation requirements, demonstrating compliance with the control's literal requirements and underlying intent.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:** N/A
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:** N/A
* **Required Human Action Steps:** N/A
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** N/A
