You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "Mechanisms exist to facilitate the implementation of strategic, operational and tactical risk management controls." (FII: FII-SCF-RSK-0001). 

## Introduction
- Provide a brief overview of the purpose of the risk management policy, emphasizing its importance in facilitating strategic, operational, and tactical risk management controls.

## Policy Statement
- Clearly state the organization's commitment to implementing effective risk management controls.

## Scope
- Explicitly define the scope of the policy to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates), and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved in risk management, such as Compliance Officer, Risk Manager, and IT Security. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Sanction Policy) for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT:
   - Describe the mechanisms for implementing risk management controls.
   
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - Suggest automated methods for evidence collection, such as using Surveilr to ingest risk registers and policy documents.

3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - Outline specific actions a human must perform, such as quarterly reviews of the risk register by the Risk Manager, with signed documentation uploaded to Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **SMART** objectives and **KPIs/SLAs** established in the policy.

## Exceptions
- Define the process for documenting any exceptions to the policy, including justification, duration, and approval.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions (creation, modification, termination), and formal documentation for all exceptions.
