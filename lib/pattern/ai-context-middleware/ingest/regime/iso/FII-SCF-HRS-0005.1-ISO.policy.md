## Introduction

The purpose of this policy is to define the acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technology within the organization. By establishing clear guidelines, we aim to ensure a secure and efficient technology environment that protects our assets, data, and the integrity of our operations. This policy serves as a framework for promoting responsible use of technology and outlines the consequences of non-compliance.

## Policy Statement

The organization maintains a firm stance on the acceptable use of technology. All workforce members are expected to utilize technology resources responsibly and in accordance with this policy. Unacceptable behavior, such as unauthorized access, misuse of data, or any actions that compromise the security of our systems, will result in disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment or legal action.

## Scope

This policy applies to all workforce members, including employees, contractors, and third-party service providers, across all organizational environments, including physical and virtual settings. It encompasses all technologies utilized within the organization, including hardware, software, and communication systems.

## Responsibilities

- **IT Security Team**: Conduct **quarterly** audits of technology use and ensure compliance with this policy.
- **Human Resources**: Update and distribute the policy **annually** to all workforce members and maintain records of employee acknowledgments.
- **Department Managers**: Monitor their teams for compliance and report any violations **immediately** to the IT Security Team.
- **All Workforce Members**: Read, understand, and comply with this policy; provide **annual** attestation of understanding.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**: Mechanisms exist to define acceptable and unacceptable rules of behavior for the use of technologies.
   
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize automated tools such as OSquery for monitoring user activity and API integrations to capture real-time usage patterns and violations.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Workforce members will sign a compliance acknowledgment form upon policy distribution, which will be documented and stored in Surveilr for future reference.

## Verification Criteria

Compliance will be validated through the following measurable criteria:
- **Percentage of workforce members** who have completed the **annual** compliance acknowledgment, targeting a minimum of **95%** compliance.
- **Number of reported violations** per quarter, with a goal of maintaining fewer than **5%** of users in violation of the policy.

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the IT Security Team. Any exceptions should detail the rationale behind them and be reviewed during the **annual review** process to ensure they remain valid and necessary.

## Lifecycle Requirements

- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs related to this policy must be retained for a minimum of **three years**.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will be reviewed and updated **annually** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness in addressing emerging technology use concerns.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
