# ISO Compliance Policy Document

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for the standardization of technology and process terminology across the organization. This is crucial for reducing confusion among various groups and departments, thereby enhancing communication, collaboration, and overall efficiency. By implementing standardized terminology, the organization aims to ensure clarity and consistency in its operations, ultimately supporting compliance with industry standards such as ISO 27001:2022.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to standardizing technology and process terminology to minimize confusion among groups and departments. This initiative aims to foster a cohesive understanding of terminology across all levels of the organization, thereby facilitating more effective communication and collaboration.

## Scope
This policy applies to all relevant entities and environments within the organization, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems

- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit information

## Responsibilities

- **IT Department:** Monthly updates to the terminology database and oversight of terminology usage across systems.
- **Department Heads:** Biannual confirmation of adherence to standardized terminology within their teams.
- **Training Coordinator:** Annual training sessions on standardized terminology for all employees.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   The requirement for standardizing terminology is to ensure that all employees and stakeholders possess a shared understanding of terms used across the organization, thereby reducing the potential for miscommunication and errors.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   To automate the collection and validation of compliance evidence, the organization will utilize API integrations that monitor and report on terminology usage across systems. This will enable real-time compliance checks and facilitate the tracking of terminology adherence.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   Department heads are required to submit signed reports confirming adherence to standardized terminology. These reports should include examples of usage and any deviations observed within their departments.

## Verification Criteria
The verification of compliance with this policy will be measured against the following criteria:
- Percentage of terminology compliance as reported by department heads (Target: 95% compliance).
- Frequency of terminology updates logged by the IT Department (Target: Monthly updates).
- Number of compliance violations or miscommunications reported (Target: Zero violations).

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. All requests for exceptions should include:
- A detailed rationale for the exception
- The proposed duration of the exception
- An assessment of the impact on operations and compliance

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** Evidence of compliance, including signed reports and automated logs, must be retained for a minimum of three years.
- **Annual Review:** This policy will be reviewed annually to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding of this policy through formal documentation. Additionally, comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to terminology usage, ensuring accountability and traceability.
