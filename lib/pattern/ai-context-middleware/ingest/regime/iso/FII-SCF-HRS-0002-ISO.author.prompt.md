You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization manage personnel security risk by assigning a risk designation to all positions and establishing screening criteria for individuals filling those positions?" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0002).

Please structure the policy document as follows:

## Introduction
- Provide an overview of the importance of managing personnel security risk and the rationale behind assigning risk designations.

## Policy Statement
- Clearly state the organization's commitment to managing personnel security risk through defined risk designations and screening criteria.

## Scope
- Explicitly define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format. Link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery actions.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT:
   - Explain the control requirement regarding personnel security risk management.
   
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - Suggest practical, automatable methods to collect evidence of compliance, such as using background check systems or HR information systems to validate risk designations and screening criteria.

3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - Describe the precise actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr, such as a manager certifying quarterly that risk designations have been reviewed and documented.

## Verification Criteria
- Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

## Exceptions
- Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification, duration, and approval.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update, specifying that policies must be **Reviewed Annually**.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.

### References
- List any external references used in the policy document in the format [Link Text](URL). If no external references exist, state "None".

Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections and that the document ends with exactly ONE References section. Emphasize the use of **SMART** instructions and the importance of documenting machine and human attestations for compliance.
