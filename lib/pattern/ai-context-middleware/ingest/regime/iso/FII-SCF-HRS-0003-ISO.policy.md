Effective role definition fosters accountability, facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements, and minimizes the risk of security breaches.

## Policy Statement

This commitment ensures that each individual understands their specific contributions to the organization's cybersecurity efforts, thereby supporting a culture of security awareness and compliance.
