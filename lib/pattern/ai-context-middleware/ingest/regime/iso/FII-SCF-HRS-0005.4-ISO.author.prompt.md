You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0005.4). 

The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Each section should adhere to the guidelines provided below:

1. **Introduction**: Explain the purpose of the policy and its importance to governance of usage policies for critical technologies.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly define the organization's stance on the governance of usage policies for critical technologies.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, such as Compliance Officer, IT Security, and others. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Sanction Policy).

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings for each requirement:
       - 1. REQUIREMENT: Explain the control requirement.
       - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical methods for automated evidence collection, such as using OSquery to collect asset inventories or API integrations with cloud providers.
       - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Provide specific verifiable actions required, like a manager certifying that inventories were reviewed, along with the documentation process for uploading evidence to Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Present clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs** in the Evidence Collection Methods section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy and the process for obtaining approval for these exceptions.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions with justification, duration, and approval.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and provides clear attestation guidance in each section. Avoid including any References subsections within individual policy sections. The document must end with exactly ONE References section, formatted as follows: 

### References
[List all external references using the format [Link Text](URL) or indicate "None" if there are no external references.]

Remember to **bold** the following keywords throughout the policy: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. Failure to bold any keyword will result in a critical non-compliance error. 

Your output must strictly follow these guidelines without any additional content.
