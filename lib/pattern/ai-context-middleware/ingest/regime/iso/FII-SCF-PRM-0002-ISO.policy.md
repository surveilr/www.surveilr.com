# ISO Policy Document for Control: FII-SCF-PRM-0002

## 1. Introduction
This policy establishes a framework for addressing all capital planning and investment requests related to cybersecurity and data privacy within the organization. As technology evolves, so do the threats to sensitive information, particularly electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). Effective capital planning is essential to ensure that adequate resources are allocated for the implementation of robust cybersecurity and data privacy programs, thereby protecting the organization's assets and maintaining trust with stakeholders.

## 2. Policy Statement
The organization is committed to a comprehensive approach to capital planning and investment requests. This includes the provision of necessary resources to implement and maintain effective cybersecurity and data privacy programs. All capital requests must incorporate elements that enhance the organization's capability to safeguard sensitive information and comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels utilized to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer:** Quarterly review of budget proposals for alignment with cybersecurity and data privacy objectives.
- **IT Security Team:** Monthly assessment of existing cybersecurity resources and identification of additional needs for capital planning.
- **Project Managers:** Ensure that all project proposals include cybersecurity and data privacy components prior to submission.
- **Finance Department:** Bi-annual evaluation of funding allocations for cybersecurity initiatives.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:** All capital planning and investment requests must be documented, outlining the resources required for cybersecurity and data privacy programs.
2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Utilize Surveilr to collect budget proposals or investment plans that explicitly include components for cybersecurity and data privacy.
3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Obtain a manager's signature on all project proposals, which must be documented and ingested into Surveilr for accountability.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be validated through measurable criteria linked to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the policy, such as:
- Percentage of budget proposals including cybersecurity components
- Frequency of compliance reviews conducted by the Compliance Officer

## 7. Exceptions
Any exceptions to the capital planning requirement must be documented through a formal process. Responsibilities for review and approval include:
- Compliance Officer: Review and recommend approval of exceptions on a quarterly basis.
- Executive Management: Final approval of documented exceptions.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention:** All evidence/logs pertaining to capital planning must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- **Annual Review:** This policy will be reviewed at least **annually** to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
