You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Does the organization compel data and/or process owners to monitor systems, applications and/or services under their control on an ongoing basis for applicable threats and risks, as well as to ensure cybersecurity & data privacy controls are operating as intended?" (FII: FII-SCF-GOV-0015.5).

## Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the importance of monitoring systems and ensuring cybersecurity and data privacy controls.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organizationâ€™s commitment to compelling data and process owners to monitor relevant systems.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to handle sensitive data.

4. **Responsibilities**: Outline specific, task-level duties for each role involved in monitoring, including:
   - **Compliance Officer**: Quarterly policy approval.
   - **IT Security**: Daily log review.
   - **Data Owners**: Ongoing risk assessment and reporting.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Describe the requirement for ongoing monitoring.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest methods for automated evidence collection (e.g., "Use monitoring tools to collect logs and alerts regarding system vulnerabilities").
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Define actions required by human stakeholders (e.g., "Management must certify monthly that monitoring tools are functioning and reporting accurately").

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **SMART** objectives and **KPIs/SLAs** (e.g., "Monitoring tools must report incidents within 24 hours, with management review completed within 48 hours").

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including the documentation required for any deviations.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum data retention periods for logs and evidence (e.g., "retain for 6 years") and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., "reviewed at least annually").

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: The document must conclude with a single References section listing any external references used in the policy.

Ensure that the policy sections do not include References subsections, and emphasize that the final document must have exactly ONE References section at the end. All enforced keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** must be **BOLD** to avoid non-compliance.
