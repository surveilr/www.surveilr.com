You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: FII-SCF-AST-0004.1. 

## Introduction
- Explain the necessity of determining cybersecurity and data privacy control applicability through effective asset scope categorization for all systems, applications, services, and personnel, including internal and third-party entities.

## Policy Statement
- Define the overarching policy that mandates the identification, assignment, and documentation of asset scope categorization.

## Scope
- Explicitly define the scope to cover all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels for creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting ePHI.

## Responsibilities
- Clearly delineate specific, task-level duties (Action Verb + Frequency) for each role involved in the asset categorization process. Link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary actions.

## Evidence Collection Methods
### 1. REQUIREMENT:
- Describe the requirement for maintaining an accurate asset inventory and documentation of data classification.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
- Suggest machine attestation methods, such as leveraging API integrations with asset management tools or using OSquery to automate collection of asset inventories.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
- Provide specific, verifiable actions a human must perform, such as a manager certifying quarterly that asset categorization has been reviewed, with documented artifacts uploaded to Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- Define clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to the KPIs/SLAs, such as "Asset inventories must be reviewed and updated quarterly."

## Exceptions
- Detail any allowable exceptions to the policy, including documentation and approval processes.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Specify the minimum data retention periods for evidence and logs (e.g., 'retain for 6 years') and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance from workforce members, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
