You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: ). 

Please create the policy document following these guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: Include the sections in this order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, and References**. Do NOT include References subsections within any individual policy section; the References section should appear only at the end of the document.

2. **Policy Sections**: Each section must include:
   - An explanation of the control requirement.
   - Suggested machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
   - Suggested human attestation methods where automation is impractical (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report").

3. **Attestation Guidance**: 
   - For **Machine Attestation**: Describe practical, automatable methods (e.g., "Verify that all production servers have asset tags by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr").
   - For **Human Attestation**: Define exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr (e.g., "Signed report is uploaded to Surveilr with metadata (review date, reviewer name)").

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (e.g., contain within 48 hours, remediate within 5 business days).

5. **Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to cover all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to handle ePHI.

6. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

7. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when automation is not feasible.

8. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section must define specific, task-level duties for each role, linking to related organizational plans as necessary.

9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

11. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings for evidence collection methods: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

12. **Verification Criteria**: Clearly outline measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined KPIs/SLAs.

13. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

14. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

15. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

16. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document**. After this section, output nothing else.

17. **References Section Format**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by "None".

Ensure that your policy maximizes machine attestability and includes specific attestation guidance for each requirement.
