You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0005.5). 

The policy document should adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy MUST follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Do NOT include References subsections within policy sections. The References section appears ONLY at the very end of the document.

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, along with a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and any channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr where machine attestation is impractical.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section MUST define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned, explicitly linking to or referencing related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Sanction Policy).

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: The policy MUST include a dedicated subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: The policy MUST require **Workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, **Comprehensive audit logging** for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

9. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Structure this section using numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

10. **Verification Criteria**: Define clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined.

11. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

12. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

13. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text MUST explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

14. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section** is the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content. 

15. **References Section Format**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None". 

The policy should ensure that mechanisms exist to manage business risks associated with permitting mobile device access to organizational resources, utilizing evidence such as BYOD Policy, Mobile Device Management (MDM) System Logs, and Mobile Device Policy or equivalent evidence.
