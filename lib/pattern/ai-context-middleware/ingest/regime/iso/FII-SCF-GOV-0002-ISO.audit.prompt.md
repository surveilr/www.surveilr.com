You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** ISO 27001:2022
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The organization establishes, maintains, and disseminates cybersecurity & data protection policies, standards, and procedures."
Control Code: FII-SCF-GOV-0002,
Control Question: Does the organization establish, maintain and disseminate cybersecurity & data protection policies, standards, and procedures?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-GOV-0002
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This document outlines the organizational policy regarding the establishment, maintenance, and dissemination of cybersecurity and data protection policies, standards, and procedures. It aims to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of sensitive data while complying with relevant regulations and standards, including ISO 27001:2022."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "1. Document management system tracking policy creation, revisions, and version control. 2. Automated notifications for upcoming policy reviews. 3. Completed Policy Development Forms for new or updated policies submitted via Surveilr. 4. Change management system logging all amendments to policies. 5. Signed Change Request Documents submitted to Surveilr. 6. Internal communication platform sending policy updates to employees. 7. Acknowledgment of Policy Receipt forms completed via Surveilr."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: ISO 27001:2022 - FII-SCF-GOV-0002

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., ISO Auditor]
**Control Code:** FII-SCF-GOV-0002
**Control Question:** Does the organization establish, maintain and disseminate cybersecurity & data protection policies, standards, and procedures?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-GOV-0002
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization establishes, maintains, and disseminates cybersecurity & data protection policies, standards, and procedures.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Establishment of Policies
    * **Provided Evidence:** Document management system tracking policy creation and revisions.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated tracking of documents via the document management system.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM policies WHERE creation_date >= LAST_YEAR;
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The provided evidence shows that policies are being tracked and managed effectively, meeting the establishment requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Maintenance of Policies
    * **Provided Evidence:** Change management system logging all amendments.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Change management system used for logging.
