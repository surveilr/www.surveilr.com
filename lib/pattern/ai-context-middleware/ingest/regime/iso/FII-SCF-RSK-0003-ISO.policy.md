# Risk Identification and Documentation Policy

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a structured approach for identifying and documenting both internal and external risks that may impact the organization. By formalizing these processes, the organization aims to enhance its risk management capabilities and ensure that all potential threats are effectively monitored and managed.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to consistently identifying and documenting risks through systematic processes that encompass both internal and external factors. This commitment is crucial for safeguarding organizational assets and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

## Scope
This policy applies to all entities within the organization, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems

All departments and personnel involved in risk management activities are required to adhere to the guidelines set forth in this policy.

## Responsibilities
- **Risk Manager: quarterly risk assessment review**
- **Compliance Officer: monthly compliance checks on risk documentation**
- **Department Heads: bi-annual submission of risk reports from their teams**
- **IT Security Team: immediate reporting of identified vulnerabilities**
- **All Staff: prompt reporting of potential risks as they arise**

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   The organization is required to identify and document risks systematically to ensure that all potential threats are recognized and managed effectively.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   Use Surveilr to pull data from the risk management system to validate risk documentation, ensuring that all entries are current and accurate.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   The Risk Manager must sign the risk assessment report, which is then uploaded to Surveilr with metadata including review date and reviewer name to maintain a verifiable audit trail.

## Verification Criteria
To ensure compliance with this policy, the following **SMART** metrics and **KPIs/SLAs** will be used:
- **Specific**: 100% of identified risks must be documented within 30 days of identification.
- **Measurable**: At least 95% of risk assessments must be reviewed quarterly.
- **Achievable**: All staff must report risks within 48 hours of identification.
- **Relevant**: Documentation must be accessible to all stakeholders within the risk management system.
- **Time-bound**: All risk documentation must be updated and reviewed bi-annually.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be documented in writing and approved by the Risk Management Committee. Each exception will be recorded in the risk register and reviewed during the **Annual Review** of this policy.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All risk management evidence must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- **Annual Review**: This policy must undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its ongoing relevance and effectiveness.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions related to risk management, and formal documentation will be required for all exceptions to this policy.
