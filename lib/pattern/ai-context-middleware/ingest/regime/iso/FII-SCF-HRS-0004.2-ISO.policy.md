# ISO Compliance Policy Document for Control: FII-SCF-HRS-0004.2

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all individuals who access systems that process, store, or transmit sensitive information are formally indoctrinated regarding the specific types of information they are authorized to access. Formal indoctrination is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information, maintaining the integrity of organizational operations, and ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. This policy aims to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and mishandling of sensitive information.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to ensuring that all personnel accessing sensitive information undergo formal training tailored to the types of information to which they have access. This training will cover the appropriate handling, management, and protection of sensitive information, thereby enhancing the security posture of the organization and reducing the likelihood of data breaches.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to systems that process, store, or transmit sensitive information. It encompasses all environments, including on-premises systems, cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and any third-party vendor systems. Additionally, it covers all channels utilized to create, receive, maintain, or transmit sensitive information.

## Responsibilities
- **Human Resources (HR):**
  - Ensure that all new hires complete formal indoctrination training before accessing sensitive information (at onboarding).
  - Maintain training records and provide periodic training updates to existing personnel (annually).
  
- **IT Security Team:**
  - Monitor compliance with training requirements and handle access control for sensitive information systems (ongoing).
  - Conduct audits of training records and access logs to ensure adherence to this policy (semi-annually).

- **Department Managers:**
  - Ensure team members receive training relevant to their specific access rights (prior to access).
  - Report any non-compliance or training failures to HR for further action (as needed).

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT:**
   - All individuals with access to sensitive information must complete formal indoctrination training relevant to the types of information they can access.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION:**
   - Utilize Learning Management Systems (LMS) to track and verify training completion. Automated notifications should be sent to both employees and supervisors upon completion of required training modules.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION:**
   - HR will maintain signed training completion logs, which will be ingested into Surveilr for record-keeping and compliance verification. Employees will be required to acknowledge understanding of their training through electronic signatures.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance validation will be measured against the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Percentage of personnel who have completed relevant indoctrination training prior to accessing sensitive information (target: 100%).
- Number of instances of unauthorized access attempts to sensitive information systems (target: zero).
- Frequency of audits conducted and compliance findings (target: bi-annual audits with no critical findings).

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted under specific circumstances, such as temporary access for urgent business needs. Such exceptions must be documented, justified, and approved by the Department Manager and HR. Exceptions will only be valid for a duration not exceeding 30 days and must be reviewed and renewed if necessary.

## Lifecycle Requirements
All training records and evidence of compliance must be retained for a minimum of six years. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure continued relevance and compliance with legal and regulatory standards.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through formal attestation. Comprehensive audit logging must be maintained for all critical actions related to access to sensitive information. Documentation of any exceptions granted must be formally recorded and reviewed.
