You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Listing of all personnel hired during the audit period" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0004). 

1. **Document Structure**: The policy MUST follow the exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Each section should explain the control requirement, suggest machine attestation methods, and suggest human attestation methods where unavoidable.

2. **Markdown Elements**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. 

3. **Attestation Guidance**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation. Describe practical, automatable methods for machine attestation (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect personnel records daily") and precise steps for human attestation (e.g., "HR must maintain a signed record of all personnel hired during the audit period, uploaded to Surveilr with metadata").

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like hiring validation and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

5. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include **all relevant entities and environments** involved in personnel hiring, including cloud-hosted systems and third-party vendor systems.

6. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

7. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

8. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section MUST define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role mentioned. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans.

9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: The policy MUST contain a dedicated subsection detailing: **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: The policy MUST require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

11. **Prohibited Content**: DO NOT include SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

12. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Structure MUST use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

13. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

14. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

15. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

16. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end.

17. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text MUST explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

18. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document**. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content. 

Ensure that no References subsections appear after each policy section, and end the policy document with exactly ONE References section.
