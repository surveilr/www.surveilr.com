You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [Audit Framework Example]
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure that management has documented formal HR procedures for employee terminations, ensuring consistency, compliance, and accountability in the termination process."
Control Code: CC1-0010,
Control Question: "Has management documented formal HR procedures that include employee terminations?"
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-HRS-0009
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy establishes the framework for documented formal Human Resource (HR) procedures related to employee terminations within the organization. It aims to ensure consistency, compliance, and accountability in the termination process, while also facilitating machine-attestable compliance through Surveilr. Management shall document and maintain formal HR procedures that outline the steps necessary for employee terminations. These procedures will ensure all terminations are conducted in a professional and compliant manner, safeguarding both organizational interests and employee rights."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Documented formal HR procedures for employee terminations exist as per policy, automated logging of HR policy updates in Surveilr, logged exit interviews for terminated employees, updated employee records in HR management systems, and documented access revocation actions in Surveilr."

**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., HR Auditor]
**Control Code:** CC1-0010
**Control Question:** Has management documented formal HR procedures that include employee terminations?

## 1. Executive Summary

This audit confirms that the organization has successfully documented formal HR procedures for employee terminations. The evidence provided demonstrates compliance with the control requirements, including machine-attestable evidence of procedure documentation and human attestation of exit interviews. Therefore, the overall audit result is a "PASS."

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Documented formal HR procedures for employee terminations.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Documented formal HR procedures exist as per policy.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated logging of HR policy updates in Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM HR_Policy WHERE Procedure_Type = 'Termination';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The documentation of HR procedures is current and has been logged in Surveilr, meeting the requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Conduct exit interviews.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Logged exit interviews for terminated employees.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated scheduling and logging of exit interviews in Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM Exit_Interviews WHERE Status = 'Completed';
