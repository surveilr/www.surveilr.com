You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Organizational chart with revision history" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0003).

### Policy Authoring Instructions:

1. **Document Structure**: Ensure the policy includes the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Do not include References subsections within any policy sections; the References section must be the final section of the document.

2. **Policy Content**: Each section must clearly explain the control requirement, provide machine attestation methods, and specify human attestation methods where necessary. 

3. **Attestation Guidance**:
   - **Machine Attestation**: Describe practical methods for automated evidence collection, such as using OSquery for configuration details, API integrations for validating access controls, and automated tasks/scripts for compliance evidence.
   - **Human Attestation**: Outline the exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr, such as signing off on reports and documenting review dates and outcomes.

4. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment or correction, along with a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

5. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

6. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

7. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when human attestation is necessary.

8. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Clearly define specific, task-level duties for all roles mentioned, linking to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

9. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

11. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation that are directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined in the policy.

12. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code.

13. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

14. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

15. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section** is the FINAL section of the policy document. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content. 

### References Section Format:
- If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format.
- If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

Ensure that the final document adheres to all the requirements outlined above, maintaining clarity and compliance throughout.
