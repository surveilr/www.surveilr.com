You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [Audit Standard/Framework]
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "To ensure that management provides a sample of five company job descriptions, facilitating compliance with organizational standards and regulatory requirements."
  * **Control Code:** CC1-0003
  * **Control Question:** Can management provide a sample of (5) company job descriptions?
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-GOV-0004
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):** "This policy outlines the procedures and requirements necessary for ensuring compliance with management's obligation to provide accurate job descriptions. It includes the responsibilities of management, the HR department, and the compliance officer in maintaining transparency and accountability in staffing practices. Management must provide job description samples quarterly, and the HR department reviews them biannually for accuracy. Compliance will be monitored by the compliance officer monthly."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Management has submitted a report detailing five job descriptions, including the job titles, responsibilities, and qualifications for each position. The report is dated and signed by the management representative responsible for the submission."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: [Audit Standard/Framework] - CC1-0003

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., Compliance Auditor]
**Control Code:** CC1-0003
**Control Question:** Can management provide a sample of (5) company job descriptions?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-GOV-0004
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** To ensure that management provides a sample of five company job descriptions, facilitating compliance with organizational standards and regulatory requirements.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Management must provide a sample of five company job descriptions.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Management has submitted a report detailing five job descriptions.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated submission tracking and report generation.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM job_descriptions WHERE submission_date = '2025-07-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence provided meets the control requirement as it includes the requisite five job descriptions, is documented, and complies with the expected submission process.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Management must maintain a signed acknowledgment form for each submission.
    * **Provided Evidence:** A signed report by the management representative is included, confirming the submission of job descriptions.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Management signed the acknowledgment form for the submission.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The signed report is stored in the compliance records.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed acknowledgment form verifies that management has fulfilled their responsibility to provide the required job descriptions.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence provided demonstrates compliance with the control's underlying purpose and intent.
* **Justification:** The submission of five job descriptions aligns with the policy's requirements and enhances compliance transparency and accountability.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** No critical gaps identified.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The provided evidence effectively demonstrates compliance with the control requirements and clearly aligns with the intent of the policy.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [For each missing piece of evidence identified in Section 2, state *exactly* what is needed. E.g., "Missing current firewall rule sets from production firewalls (FII-XYZ-001) for the quarter ending 2025-06-30."]
    * [Specify the required format/type for each missing piece: e.g., "Obtain OSquery results for network interface configurations on all servers tagged 'production_web'.", "Provide a signed PDF of the latest incident response plan approval."]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [For each instance of non-compliant evidence identified in Section 2, clearly state *why* it is non-compliant and what *specific correction* is required. E.g., "Provided access logs show unapproved access event on 2025-07-15 by UserID 123; requires an associated incident ticket (IR-2025-005) or justification."]
    * [Specify the action needed: e.g., "Remediate firewall rule CC6-0010-005 to correctly block traffic from IP range X.Y.Z.0/24.", "Provide evidence of user access review completion for Q2 2025 for all critical systems."]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [List precise steps a human auditor or compliance officer needs to take. E.g., "Engage IT Operations to retrieve the specific logs for server X from date Y.", "Contact system owner Z to obtain management attestation for policy P."]
    * [Specify which teams or individuals are responsible for producing or correcting the evidence.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [Outline the process for re-submission of the corrected/missing evidence for re-evaluation.]
