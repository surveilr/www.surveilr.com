You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Has management documented formal HR procedures that include the employee on-boarding process?" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0004). 

## Policy Structure
The policy document must follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** 

### Document Sections Instructions
1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's intent and purpose.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the policy regarding HR procedures and employee onboarding.
3. **Scope**: Define the scope explicitly, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems, as well as all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific **Action Verb + Frequency** responsibilities for each role involved in the onboarding process.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings for each requirement with:
     1. **REQUIREMENT**: Explain the control requirement.
     2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection (e.g., "Use API integrations with HR systems to verify onboarding completion").
     3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Describe precise steps and artifacts for human attestation (e.g., "HR manager certifies onboarding checklist and uploads it to Surveilr").
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for requesting and documenting exceptions.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy **Annual Review**.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation and comprehensive audit logging for critical actions.

### Markdown Formatting
- Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
- Ensure keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are **BOLD** in the text.

### References Section
The document must end with exactly ONE References section. Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

### Prohibited Content
Do not include SQL queries, code blocks, pseudo-code, or References subsections within policy sections. 

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability, includes specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound instructions (SMART), and adheres strictly to the outlined structure and requirements.
