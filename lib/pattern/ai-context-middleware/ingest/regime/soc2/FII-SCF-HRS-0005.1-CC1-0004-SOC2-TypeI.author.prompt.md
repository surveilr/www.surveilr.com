You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "CC1-0004" (FII: "FII-SCF-HRS-0005.1"). 

The policy document must follow this exact structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and end with a single **References** section. 

1. **Introduction**: Clearly explain the purpose and importance of the policy.
2. **Policy Statement**: Articulate the organization's commitment to maintaining a handbook that includes entity values and behavioral standards.
3. **Scope**: Define the policy's applicability to all employees, and explicitly include cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.
4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties for roles such as HR and Compliance Officer, using **Action Verbs + Frequency**.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Describe the requirement for an employee handbook.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest methods for automating evidence collection, such as tracking access to the handbook via the organization's intranet.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Specify the precise actions and artifacts, like an HR manager maintaining a signed acknowledgment log.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.
7. **Exceptions**: Define any exceptions to the policy and the process for requesting them.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include **Data Retention** policies for documentation, specify a mandatory frequency for **Annual Review**, and detail the minimum retention periods for evidence.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require acknowledgment of the policy by workforce members, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that each section maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance. Specifically, provide clear operational steps with **SMART** instructions, including a bulleted list of 3-5 steps for any processes like containment or correction, with specific time-bound metrics.

Remember, do not include References subsections within individual policy sections; the References section must appear only at the very end of the document.
