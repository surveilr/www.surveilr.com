You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "CC1-0009" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0003.2). 

The policy must follow this structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.** Each section must include the following:

1. **Introduction:** Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance.
   
2. **Policy Statement:** Clearly articulate the core policy directive.

3. **Scope:** Explicitly define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities:** Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, including **Action Verb + Frequency**. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods:** 
   - Use numbered subheadings per requirement:
     - "1. REQUIREMENT:"
     - "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:"
     - "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:"
   - Suggest practical, automatable methods for machine attestation, and define exact actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods for human attestation.

6. **Verification Criteria:** Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the Evidence Collection Methods.

7. **Exceptions:** Define any exceptions to the policy and their approval process.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements:** Include a dedicated subsection detailing minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit:** Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

The policy must maximize machine attestability. Every policy section must include attestation guidance and specific SMART instructions replacing general statements. The policy should not include any References subsections within the individual sections; the References section should only appear once at the end of the document, containing exactly ONE References section in the format: 

### References
[List any external references here using the format [Link Text](URL)].

Ensure the policy uses standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. The enforced keywords—**SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**—must be explicitly used and bolded in the text.

End the document with the References section and do not include any additional content.
