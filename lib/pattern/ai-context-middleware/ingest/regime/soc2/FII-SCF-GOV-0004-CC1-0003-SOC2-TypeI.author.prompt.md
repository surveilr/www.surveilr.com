You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "" (FII: FII-SCF-GOV-0004). 

The policy document must follow the exact structure outlined below, ensuring that each section maximizes machine attestability while providing clear human attestation methods where necessary. The policy should include the following sections in this order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the policy's purpose and relevance to compliance automation.
  
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly define the policy's objectives and its alignment with compliance standards.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the policy's applicability to all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems. 

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) for each role mentioned, linking to related organizational plans such as the Incident Response Plan. 

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Describe the control requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Specify precise steps and artifacts for human evidence collection.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and the **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update** (e.g., **Annual Review**).

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability by including specific, verifiable methods for evidence collection and documentation. Avoid including References subsections within individual policy sections; instead, include a single **References** section at the end of the document.

Emphasize and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the policy.

The document must conclude with exactly ONE **References** section, and no other content is to be included after this section.
