You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [Your chosen audit standard/framework]
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "[The control CC1-0005 mandates that key policies and procedures, including those related to Information Security, Change Management, Incident Management, and the Code of Conduct/Employee Handbook, be made readily accessible to employees through the company's intranet or shared drive. This policy outlines the requirements for ensuring that these critical documents are available, as well as the methods for compliance verification.]"
  * **Control Code:** CC1-0005
  * **Control Question:** Screenshot showing key policies and procedures (e.g. Information Security, Change Management, Incident Management) and the code of conduct/employee handbook were available to employees via company intranet or shared drive
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-TPM-0002
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "[It is the policy of [Organization Name] to ensure that all employees have **consistent** access to key policies and procedures via a secure and user-friendly platform, such as the company intranet or designated shared drive. This access will promote awareness and adherence to organizational standards and practices. The IT Department ensures that all key policies and procedures are uploaded and updated on the intranet/shared drive monthly. The Compliance Officer conducts a quarterly review of document accessibility and reports findings to management.]"
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "[Access logs indicating that 95% of employees accessed the policies within the last year, screenshot of intranet showing key policies available, and signed employee acknowledgment forms stored in Surveilr.]"

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: [Your chosen audit standard/framework] - CC1-0005

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., HIPAA Auditor]
**Control Code:** CC1-0005
**Control Question:** Screenshot showing key policies and procedures (e.g. Information Security, Change Management, Incident Management) and the code of conduct/employee handbook were available to employees via company intranet or shared drive
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-TPM-0002
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** [The control CC1-0005 mandates that key policies and procedures, including those related to Information Security, Change Management, Incident Management, and the Code of Conduct/Employee Handbook, be made readily accessible to employees through the company's intranet or shared drive. This policy outlines the requirements for ensuring that these critical documents are available, as well as the methods for compliance verification.]

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Key policies and procedures must be accessible on the intranet/shared drive.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Access logs indicating that 95% of employees accessed the policies within the last year.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Utilized OSquery to collect data on file access logs.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM access_logs WHERE document IN (key_policies) AND access_date >= '2024-01-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence shows that the access logs corroborate that the majority of employees accessed the key policies, meeting the control requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Screenshot of the intranet showing key policies available.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Screenshot provided.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** N/A for machine attestation.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The screenshot confirms that the policies are available on the intranet as required.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Employees must acknowledge receipt and understanding of the policies.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed employee acknowledgment forms stored in Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Employees signing acknowledgment forms.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Stored in Surveilr as an artifact.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed acknowledgment forms confirm that employees received and understood the policies, meeting the control requirement.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates that the control's underlying purpose and intent are being met in practice.
* **Justification:** The accessibility of key policies and the acknowledgment by employees ensure that the organization adheres to its compliance obligations.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None identified.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit found that all aspects of the control requirements were met through both machine attestation and human attestation, demonstrating compliance with the control intent.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * [N/A as the audit result is PASS.]
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * [N/A as the audit result is PASS.]
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * [N/A as the audit result is PASS.]
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** [N/A as the audit result is PASS.]
