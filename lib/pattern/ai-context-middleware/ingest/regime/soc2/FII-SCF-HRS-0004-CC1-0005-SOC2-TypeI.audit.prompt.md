You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [Audit Framework/Standard]
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "[The underlying intent of the control is to ensure that all new employees receive a structured onboarding experience that complies with organizational policies and legal requirements, promoting a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities.]"
    Control Code: CC1-0005,
    Control Question: "Has management documented formal HR procedures that include the employee on-boarding process?"
    Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-HRS-0004
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "[This policy establishes formal procedures for the employee onboarding process, ensuring that new employees are efficiently integrated into the workforce while complying with legal and regulatory requirements. It outlines the responsibilities of management and HR personnel to document and maintain these procedures effectively.]"
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "[Evidence includes API integration results from HR systems showing the creation and updates of onboarding documentation, confirmation from the HR manager regarding the attestation of onboarding checklist documentation uploaded to Surveilr, and automated tracking logs indicating the onboarding progress for new employees.]"

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: [Audit Standard/Framework] - CC1-0005

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., HR Compliance Auditor]
**Control Code:** CC1-0005
**Control Question:** "Has management documented formal HR procedures that include the employee on-boarding process?"
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-HRS-0004
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The underlying intent of the control is to ensure that all new employees receive a structured onboarding experience that complies with organizational policies and legal requirements, promoting a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities."

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Documented onboarding procedures must be created and maintained.
    * **Provided Evidence:** API integration results from HR systems confirming the existence and updates of onboarding documentation.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Utilized API integrations with HR systems to verify the existence and updates of onboarding documentation.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM onboarding_docs WHERE updated_at >= '2025-01-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence demonstrates that documented onboarding procedures exist and are regularly maintained as per the policy requirements.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Onboarding completion must be tracked for each new employee.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated tracking logs detailing onboarding progress for new employees.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Implemented automated tracking systems to log onboarding progress in real-time.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT employee_id, onboarding_status FROM onboarding_progress WHERE onboarding_status = 'completed';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The automated logs provide clear evidence of tracking onboarding completion, aligning with the control requirements.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Compliance with onboarding procedures must be validated regularly.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Compliance audit reports generated from HR systems.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Generated compliance reports from HR systems to be reviewed by the Compliance Officer.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM compliance_reports WHERE report_date >= '2025-01-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The compliance reports are regularly generated and reviewed, confirming adherence to the onboarding procedures.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** The HR manager certifies onboarding checklist documentation.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Confirmation from the HR manager regarding the attestation of onboarding checklist documentation uploaded to Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** HR manager manually certifies completion of onboarding documentation.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** The act of human attestation is recorded in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
