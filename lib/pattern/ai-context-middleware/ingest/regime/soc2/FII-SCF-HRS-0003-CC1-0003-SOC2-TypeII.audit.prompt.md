You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [Audit Standard/Framework]
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The purpose of this control is to ensure that the organizational structure is transparent and accountable by maintaining an updated organizational chart with a detailed revision history, thereby facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements."
  * **Control Code:** CC1-0003
  * **Control Question:** Organizational chart with revision history
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-HRS-0003
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "This policy establishes the framework for maintaining an organizational chart with a detailed revision history to ensure transparency, clarity of roles, and accountability within the organization. The organizational chart serves as a critical resource for understanding the structure and reporting lines of the organization, as well as facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Evidence includes collected OSquery data for organizational chart access logs, API results confirming access control integrity, signed attestations from HR personnel, and audit logs demonstrating updates to the organizational chart."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: [Audit Standard/Framework] - CC1-0003

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., HIPAA Auditor]
**Control Code:** CC1-0003
**Control Question:** Organizational chart with revision history
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-HRS-0003
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The purpose of this control is to ensure that the organizational structure is transparent and accountable by maintaining an updated organizational chart with a detailed revision history, thereby facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Audit logs showing updates to the organizational chart.
    * **Provided Evidence:** OSquery data of access logs confirming updates to the organizational chart.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** OSquery for endpoint data collection.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM organizational_chart_updates WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The OSquery results confirm that updates to the organizational chart have been logged correctly, meeting the control requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** API integrations validating access controls.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Results from API calls confirm only authorized personnel can modify the chart.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** API calls to validate access controls.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM access_control WHERE role = 'HR' AND can_modify = 'true';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** API results demonstrate that access controls are functioning as intended, ensuring only authorized personnel can modify the organizational chart.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Signed attestations from HR on changes.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Scanned signed attestations stored in Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** HR personnel signing off on changes to the organizational chart.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Signed documents stored as PDFs in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The signed attestations provide clear evidence of HR oversight and compliance with the control requirements.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent & Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence demonstrates adherence to the control's underlying purpose of maintaining transparency and accountability within the organizational structure.
* **Justification:** The evidence collected through both machine and human attestation methods supports the intent of the policy by ensuring that the organizational chart is regularly updated and verified.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** None identified; all evidence aligns with the control's spirit.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** PASS
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** The audit found that all provided evidence meets the control requirements and demonstrates the underlying intent of maintaining an updated organizational chart with a detailed revision history.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
