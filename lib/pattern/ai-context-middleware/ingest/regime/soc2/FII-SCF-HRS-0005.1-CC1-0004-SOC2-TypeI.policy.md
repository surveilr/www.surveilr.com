## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all employees have access to a comprehensive employee handbook that articulates the organization's entity values and behavioral standards. The existence of a well-defined handbook is crucial for fostering a transparent and consistent work environment, guiding employee behavior, and aligning individual actions with the organization's mission and values.

## Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to maintaining an employee handbook that clearly outlines entity values and behavioral standards. This handbook serves as a foundational document promoting a culture of integrity, respect, and accountability among all staff members.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
