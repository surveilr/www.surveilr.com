# Policy Document for Control: Signed Employee Handbook and Code of Conduct Acknowledgements for a Sample of New Hires

## 1. Introduction
This policy establishes a framework for obtaining and managing signed acknowledgements of the employee handbook and code of conduct from new hires. The purpose of this policy is to ensure compliance with organizational standards and regulatory requirements, fostering a culture of accountability and ethical behavior within the workplace. Signed acknowledgements serve as a critical component in safeguarding the organizationâ€™s values and ensuring that employees are aware of their responsibilities and the resources available to them.

## 2. Policy Statement
All new hires must provide signed acknowledgements of the employee handbook and code of conduct within their first week of employment. These acknowledgements must be documented and securely stored to ensure easy retrieval for compliance verification.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all new hires across all organizational entities, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information (ePHI)

## 4. Responsibilities
- **HR Team**: **Collect** signed acknowledgements from new hires **weekly** and **store** them in a secure electronic repository.
- **IT Department**: **Ensure** the secure storage and access controls of the repository **bi-annually**.
- **Compliance Officer**: **Review** and **report** compliance status regarding signed acknowledgements **quarterly**.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
### 1. REQUIREMENT
New hires must sign and submit the employee handbook and code of conduct acknowledgements.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION
Utilize document management systems that automatically track and log the submission of signed acknowledgements, generating alerts for any outstanding documents.

In cases where automation is impractical, HR must manually collect signed documents and upload them into the Surveilr system. This includes:
- Verifying signatures against employee records
- Logging the date of receipt and employee ID
- Uploading the documents to Surveilr with appropriate metadata

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated through the following measurable criteria:
- **100%** of new hires must have signed acknowledgements documented within their first week (KPI).
- Audit logs must show that all acknowledgements have been securely stored and are retrievable upon request (SLA).

## 7. Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Compliance Officer and documented in the formal exception log. Any exceptions must be justified with a clear rationale and will be reviewed annually.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Signed acknowledgements must be retained for a minimum of **five years** following the termination of employment.
- **Annual Review**: This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure it remains current with regulatory requirements and organizational standards.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge receipt of the employee handbook and code of conduct through signed documentation. Comprehensive audit logging must track:
- Acknowledgement submissions
- Exception approvals
- Document access history

Formal documentation must be maintained for all exceptions, including the approval process and rationale.
