You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0003). 

Please structure the policy document as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the policy and its objectives.
3. **Scope**: Define the scope explicitly, including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Specify granular roles with **Action Verb + Frequency** for each role involved in compliance with this policy.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings for each requirement:
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Explain the control requirement.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection and validation.
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Outline specific actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the defined **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including their documentation requirements.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update, including **Annual Review**.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging, and formal documentation for all exceptions.
10. **References**: Include one References section at the very end of the document; do not include References subsections within policy sections.

Ensure all sections emphasize machine attestability and provide operational detail with **SMART** instructions. Highlight any enforced keywords in bold, including **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

The policy must follow the mandatory order specified above, and there should be no control identifiers, control questions, or FII IDs in the document. End with exactly ONE References section.
