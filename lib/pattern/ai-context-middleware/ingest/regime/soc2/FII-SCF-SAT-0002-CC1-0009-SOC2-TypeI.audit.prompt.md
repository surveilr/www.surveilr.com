You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [Your Audit Standard/Framework Here]
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The mentor program aims to develop personnel by fostering a supportive environment for guidance, experience sharing, and professional development, aligning individual growth with organizational objectives."
Control Code: CC1-0009,
Control Question: Is there a mentor program to develop personnel in place?
Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII): FII-SCF-SAT-0002
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "The organization is committed to continuous development through a structured mentor program, which includes documented mentorship sessions, feedback collection, and tracking career progression. Evidence will be collected through automated systems and manual attestations to validate the effectiveness of the program."
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Evidence includes automated logs of mentorship session attendance, scanned signed acknowledgment forms from mentors and mentees, automated feedback survey results, and periodic HR reports tracking mentee career progression metrics."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**


# Official Audit Report: [Your Audit Standard/Framework Here] - CC1-0009

**Overall Audit Result:** [PASS/FAIL]
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., Mentor Program Auditor]
**Control Code:** CC1-0009
**Control Question:** Is there a mentor program to develop personnel in place?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-SAT-0002
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The mentor program aims to develop personnel by fostering a supportive environment for guidance, experience sharing, and professional development, aligning individual growth with organizational objectives.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Documented mentorship sessions must occur regularly.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated logs of mentorship session schedules and attendance from HR management software.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Evidence collected through automated logging in HR software.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM mentorship_sessions WHERE status = 'completed';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence demonstrates that mentorship sessions are logged systematically, fulfilling the control requirement.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Feedback must be collected from participants.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Results from automated post-mentorship surveys.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated survey tools integrated with Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT AVG(feedback_score) FROM mentorship_feedback WHERE session_id = [X];
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** Feedback is systematically gathered, indicating participant satisfaction and alignment with the control requirements.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Tracking of career progression of mentees.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Periodic HR reports validating progression metrics.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Integration with performance management systems.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM mentee_progress WHERE date >= [Y];
    * **Compliance Status:** INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
    * **Justification:** While reports exist, further detail on metrics and individual progression tracking is required to fully validate compliance.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Signed acknowledgment forms from mentors and mentees must be collected.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Scanned signed acknowledgment forms uploaded to Surveilr.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Mentors and mentees signing acknowledgment forms after each session.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Uploading scanned forms to Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The presence of signed forms provides clear human attestation of participation in the mentorship sessions.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Manual feedback forms must be collected.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Scanned feedback forms from mentorship sessions.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Collection and scanning of feedback forms.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Stored in Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** NON-COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** Some feedback forms were not submitted; this lacks completeness in the evidence collection process.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent Spirit

* **Assessment:** The evidence generally supports the control's intent, but the gaps in tracking career progression and collection of manual feedback forms raise concerns.
* **Justification:** While most evidence is compliant, the absence of comprehensive tracking for career progression and incomplete feedback collection detracts from the mentorship program's effectiveness.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** The lack of detailed progression tracking and incomplete feedback hinder the program's ability to assess its impact fully.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** FAIL
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** While there is a structured mentor program and evidence for its operation, critical gaps in evidence collection, particularly in tracking career progression and feedback, lead to an overall non-compliance determination.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * Detailed tracking reports for mentee career progression (FII-SCF-SAT-0002).
    * Submission of all missing manual feedback forms from mentorship sessions.

* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * Provide evidence of all feedback forms collected from mentorship sessions for the past quarter; missing forms must be obtained and scanned accordingly.

* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * Engage HR to retrieve and compile the missing career progression tracking data.
    * Contact mentors and mentees to ensure all feedback forms are completed and submitted.

* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** Once the missing evidence is collected and corrections are made, resubmit all documentation for re-evaluation within 30 days.
