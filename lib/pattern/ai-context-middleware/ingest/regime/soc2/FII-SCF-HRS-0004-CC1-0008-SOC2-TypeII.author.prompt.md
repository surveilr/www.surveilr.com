You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Listing of all current employees, including executive management" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0004).

## Instructions for Policy Authoring:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections; the References section should only appear at the end of the document.

2. **Policy Requirements**:
   - Each section must explain the control requirement clearly.
   - Provide specific, actionable, and measurable methods for machine attestability using Surveilr.
   - Include human attestation methods where necessary.
   - Ensure all statements are **SMART** (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Time-bound).

3. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - Use the mandatory structure: Numbered subheadings for "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".
   - For machine attestation, describe specific automatable methods for evidence collection.
   - For human attestation, outline precise actions, artifacts, and methods for ingestion into Surveilr.

4. **Operational Detail**: Provide 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment or correction, along with specific KPIs/SLAs for completion times.

5. **Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to encompass all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

6. **Responsibilities**: Clearly define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using action verbs and frequencies. Include links to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., "reviewed at least annually").

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.

9. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code for technical terms.

10. **Hyperlinks**: Use the format [Link Text](URL) for external references and ensure a single References section at the end.

11. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

At the end of the policy document, include exactly ONE References section. Do not output anything else after this section. Ensure that no control identifiers, metadata, or additional content appear in the document.
