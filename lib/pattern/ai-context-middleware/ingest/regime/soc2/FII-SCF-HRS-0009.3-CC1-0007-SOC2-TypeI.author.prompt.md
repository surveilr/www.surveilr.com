You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : CC1-0007 (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0009.3).

## Policy Structure

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy, its purpose, and the importance of compliance in recruitment practices.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to fair and compliant recruitment practices, ensuring alignment with relevant regulations.

3. **Scope**: Define the scope of the policy, explicitly including all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems involved in recruitment.

4. **Responsibilities**: Detail specific, task-level duties for each role involved in the recruitment process, including the frequency of actions (e.g., HR Manager: monthly recruitment review).

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the recruitment policies and procedures.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest how evidence can be collected automatically, such as by retrieving recruitment data from HR software through API integrations.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Specify actions like a manager certifying recruitment compliance quarterly, with signed documentation uploaded to Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Define clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs established in the requirements section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including required justification and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for recruitment evidence (e.g., retain for 3 years) and specify the mandatory frequency of policy review and update (e.g., reviewed at least annually).

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **References**: Conclude the document with exactly ONE References section, ensuring no References subsections appear within individual policy sections.

### Key Instructions

- Use H2 headings (##) for major requirements.
- Utilize Markdown formatting, including paragraphs, bullet points, bold text, and inline code for technical terms.
- Ensure every policy section emphasizes **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** by bolding these keywords.
- Focus on describing methods without embedding SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.
- Ensure no References subsections appear after each policy section, and the final section must contain a single References section.
