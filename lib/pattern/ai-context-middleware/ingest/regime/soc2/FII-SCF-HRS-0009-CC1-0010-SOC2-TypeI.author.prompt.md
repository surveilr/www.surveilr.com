You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "Has management documented formal HR procedures that include employee terminations?" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0009). 

The policy must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy MUST follow this exact section order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.**

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like termination, include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** (e.g., conduct exit interview, retrieve company assets, update access controls) and a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)** (e.g., complete termination process within 5 business days).

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, including **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems**.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation related to HR procedures.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation**: When necessary, define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section MUST define **specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency)** for each role mentioned (e.g., HR Manager: conduct exit interviews; IT: revoke access). **Explicitly link to related organizational plans** (e.g., Incident Response Plan).

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for termination records (e.g., 'retain for 7 years') and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update** (e.g., 'reviewed at least annually').

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: The policy MUST require **Workforce member acknowledgment/attestation** of understanding and compliance, and **Comprehensive audit logging** for all critical actions.

9. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

10. **Verification Criteria**: Include clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined.

11. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

12. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

13. **Prohibited Content**: Do not include References subsections within policy sections; they must appear only at the end of the document.

14. **Final Section Requirements**: The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document**. 

15. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text MUST explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

The policy document must be comprehensive, clear, and primarily machine-attestable through Surveilr, ensuring a 100% compliance score by addressing every rule in the 'Requirements for the Policy Document' section.
