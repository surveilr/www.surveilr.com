You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Is there a mentor program to develop personnel in place?" (FII: FII-SCF-SAT-0002). 

Your policy document must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections; the References section must only appear at the end of the document.

### Instructions for Each Section:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly explain the purpose of the policy and the importance of having a mentor program for personnel development.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the organization's commitment to developing personnel through a structured mentor program.

3. **Scope**: Define the applicability of the policy, ensuring to cover all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify the roles involved in the mentorship program. For each role, provide specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verb + Frequency**) to enhance clarity.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Use numbered subheadings per requirement:
     1. **REQUIREMENT**: State each mentorship requirement.
     2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Describe practical, automatable methods to collect evidence of the mentorship program's effectiveness.
     3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Detail exact actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Outline clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.

7. **Exceptions**: Define the process for requesting exceptions to the policy, including documentation and approval requirements.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail the **Data Retention** periods for evidence and the **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

Ensure your policy maximizes machine attestability, including attestation guidance in every section. Use standard Markdown formatting with headings, bullet points, and **bold text** for emphasis. 

At the end of the document, include exactly ONE **References** section formatted as follows:
- If external references exist, list them under **### References** using [Link Text](URL) format.
- If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

Ensure to **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. Failure to do so will result in critical non-compliance. 

Remember, no SQL queries or code blocks should be included, and do not output any content after the References section.
