You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: CC1-0001 (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0005). 

The policy document must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References.** Ensure that each section follows these guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: Use H2 headings (##) for each major section. Each section must:
   - Explain the control requirement.
   - Suggest **machine attestation** methods, such as using OSquery or API integrations.
   - Suggest **human attestation** methods when automation is impractical, detailing specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr.

2. **Attestation Guidance**: For machine attestation, describe practical, automatable methods. For human attestation, provide precise steps and artifacts.

3. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** for processes such as containment or correction, along with a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

4. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems,** and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

5. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section must define specific duties for each role mentioned with **Action Verb + Frequency** and explicitly link to related organizational plans.

6. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **minimum data retention** periods for evidence/logs and **mandatory frequency for policy review and update.**

7. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

8. **Prohibited Content**: Do not write or embed SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code. Do not include References subsections within policy sections.

9. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Each requirement must be structured with numbered subheadings: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

10. **Verification Criteria**: Include clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined.

11. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

12. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

13. **Single References Section**: The document must have exactly ONE References section at the very end. Do not include control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content after this section.

14. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

15. **Final Section Requirements**: The References section is the final section of the policy document, and the document must end there.

Ensure that References subsections do not appear after each policy section. The policy document must end with exactly ONE References section.
