You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : "Signed employee handbook and code of conduct acknowledgements for a sample of new hires" (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0005). 

The policy document must follow this structure without including References subsections within individual policy sections:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance.
   
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the policy requirements regarding signed acknowledgements.

3. **Scope**: Define the policy's applicability to all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Specify granular, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role involved, including links to related organizational plans.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**:
   - **1. REQUIREMENT**: Describe the specific requirement.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Outline precise actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr when automation is impractical.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Define clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **KPIs/SLAs** specified in the policy.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline any exceptions to the policy, including approval processes.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail **Data Retention** periods and **Annual Review** frequency for the policy.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Describe requirements for workforce member acknowledgement/attestation, comprehensive audit logging, and formal documentation for exceptions.

10. **References**: This section must be the final section of the policy document, containing exactly ONE list of references in the format [Link Text](URL) or stating "None" if there are no references.

Ensure that every section maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance, following the rules for operational detail and specificity, while emphasizing that the policy must contain **SMART** instructions. Prohibited content includes SQL queries or code blocks, and all enforced keywords must be **BOLD**: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**. 

Remember, do not include References subsections within policy sections; the References section must only appear at the end of the document.
