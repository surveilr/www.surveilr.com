You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "Listing of business partners / third parties / vendors / service providers" (FII: FII-SCF-TPM-0001). 

The policy must follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the policy's purpose and importance.

2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the policy's intent regarding the listing of business partners, third parties, vendors, and service providers.

3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for each role involved in the policy, such as Compliance Officer, IT Security, and any other relevant roles. Ensure to link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - **1. REQUIREMENT:** Describe the requirement for maintaining a list of business partners and third-party services.
   - **2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Suggest methods for automated evidence collection/validation, such as using API integrations to validate the list of third-party vendors.
   - **3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Provide specific actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr, such as a manager certifying the accuracy of the vendor list quarterly.

6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to **SMART** KPIs/SLAs defined in the previous section.

7. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for documenting exceptions, including justification, duration, and approval.

8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs (e.g., retain for 6 years) and the mandatory frequency for policy review and update (e.g., reviewed at least **annually**).

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.

10. **References**: The document must conclude with a single References section at the very end. Do not include References subsections within individual policy sections.

Ensure that every section includes attestation guidance, emphasizing machine attestability, and include **bolded** keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the policy. Failure to do so will result in non-compliance.
