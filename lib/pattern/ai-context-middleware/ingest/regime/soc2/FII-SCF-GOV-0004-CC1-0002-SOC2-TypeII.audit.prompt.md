You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [NIST Cybersecurity Framework]
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "[The organization mandates the development and maintenance of comprehensive job descriptions for all executive management roles. These descriptions must clearly articulate the primary responsibilities, required skills, and expertise necessary for effective leadership.]"
  * **Control Code:** CC1-0002
  * **Control Question:** Job descriptions that define (1) the role and responsibilities and (2) the skills and expertise needed of executive management (e.g. President, CIO, CTO, CEO, CFO, etc.) Please provide evidence of executive management job postings if available as well.
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-GOV-0004
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):** "[This policy outlines the framework for defining the roles and responsibilities of executive management within the organization. It is essential for ensuring accountability, operational efficiency, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Executive management positions such as President, CIO, CTO, CEO, and CFO play critical roles in steering the organization towards its strategic goals. The clarity provided by this policy will enhance decision-making processes and ensure that responsibilities align with the organizationâ€™s objectives.]"
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "[Job descriptions for President, CIO, CTO, CEO, and CFO roles have been documented and are stored in the HR management system. The documents include a signed acknowledgment form from each executive confirming their understanding of their roles and responsibilities. Job descriptions have been reviewed and updated quarterly, with the latest revisions dated April 2025.]"

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: NIST Cybersecurity Framework - CC1-0002

**Overall Audit Result: PASS**
**Date of Audit:** 2025-07-28
**Auditor Role:** Official Auditor
**Control Code:** CC1-0002
**Control Question:** Job descriptions that define (1) the role and responsibilities and (2) the skills and expertise needed of executive management (e.g. President, CIO, CTO, CEO, CFO, etc.) Please provide evidence of executive management job postings if available as well.
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-GOV-0004
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The organization mandates the development and maintenance of comprehensive job descriptions for all executive management roles. These descriptions must clearly articulate the primary responsibilities, required skills, and expertise necessary for effective leadership.

## 1. Executive Summary

The audit findings demonstrate that the provided evidence adequately supports compliance with the control requirements. The organization has maintained comprehensive job descriptions for all executive management roles, which have been regularly reviewed and updated. The signed acknowledgment forms from executives confirm their understanding of their responsibilities. As a result, the audit decision is "PASS."

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Each executive management role must have a documented job description that outlines the responsibilities and required skills.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Job descriptions for President, CIO, CTO, CEO, and CFO roles are documented and stored in the HR management system.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion from the HR management system, with version control tracking updates.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM job_descriptions WHERE role IN ('President', 'CIO', 'CTO', 'CEO', 'CFO');
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence clearly demonstrates that all executive roles have documented job descriptions that meet the control's requirements.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Job descriptions must be reviewed and updated at least once every quarter.
    * **Provided Evidence:** The latest revisions of job descriptions are dated April 2025, indicating compliance with the quarterly review requirement.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Tracking of updates in the HR management system.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM job_descriptions WHERE last_review_date >= '2025-04-01';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The job descriptions have been updated in accordance with the policy, verifying compliance with the review requirement.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Require executive management to sign an acknowledgment form confirming the understanding and acceptance of their job descriptions and responsibilities annually.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed acknowledgment forms from each executive confirming their understanding of their roles and responsibilities.
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Executives signed acknowledgment forms.
