You're an **official auditor (e.g., auditor)**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

  * **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
  * **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
      * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
      * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
      * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
  * **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
      * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
      * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
      * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
  * **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

  * **Audit Standard/Framework:** [****]
  * **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "[New hire checklists serve as essential tools in facilitating new hire procedures, ensuring that all necessary activities are completed systematically.]"
  * **Control Code:** CC1-0006
  * **Control Question:** Are new hire checklists utilized and activities documented to help facilitate new hire procedures?
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-HRS-0004
  * **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
    "[Our organization is committed to utilizing new hire checklists as part of the onboarding process and to documenting all related activities diligently. This policy ensures that every new hire receives the necessary guidance and resources to become productive members of the team in a timely manner.]"
  * **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "[Evidence from the HR management system showing the completion of new hire checklists with timestamps and associated profiles, as well as scanned signed policy acknowledgement forms from hiring managers.]"

**Requirements for Your Audit Report  (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: [Audit Standard/Framework] - CC1-0006

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., HR Compliance Auditor]
**Control Code:** CC1-0006
**Control Question:** Are new hire checklists utilized and activities documented to help facilitate new hire procedures?
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-HRS-0004
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** New hire checklists serve as essential tools in facilitating new hire procedures, ensuring that all necessary activities are completed systematically.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** New hire checklists must be logged in the HR management system.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Evidence from the HR management system showing the completion of new hire checklists with timestamps and associated profiles.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Automated data ingestion through the HR management system.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM new_hire_checklists WHERE completion_status = 'completed';
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence demonstrates that all checklist items were logged with timestamps, showing adherence to the control.

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Hiring managers must sign off on the completion of the checklist.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Scanned signed policy acknowledgement forms from hiring managers.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Human attestation recorded in the HR management system.
    * **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT
    * **Justification:** The evidence provides documented human attestation with signatures confirming completion and compliance with the onboarding process.

### 2.2 Human Attestation Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Managers are required to document any additional training or onboarding activities.
    * **Provided Evidence:** [Details on additional training documentation, if available; otherwise state absence.]
    * **Human Action Involved (as per control/standard):** Managers must record completion of additional training.
    * **Surveilr Recording/Tracking:** Evidence stored in the HR management system.
    * **Compliance Status:** INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
    * **Justification:** While initial checklist completion is well documented, there is a lack of evidence regarding additional training documentation, which is necessary to fully comply with the control.

## 3. Overall Alignment with Control's Intent  Spirit

* **Assessment:** The provided evidence mostly demonstrates adherence to the intent by showing structured onboarding processes.
* **Justification:** The evidence presented aligns with the control's purpose but lacks complete documentation of additional training activities.
* **Critical Gaps in Spirit (if applicable):** The absence of documentation for additional training activities suggests a potential gap in the thoroughness of the onboarding process.

## 4. Audit Conclusion and Final Justification

* **Final Decision:** FAIL
* **Comprehensive Rationale:** Although significant aspects of the control have been met, the lack of documented evidence for additional training activities leads to a determination of non-compliance.

## 5. Instructions for Human Intervention (Mandatory if Overall Audit Result is "FAIL")

**If the Overall Audit Result is "FAIL", provide clear, actionable, and precise instructions for human intervention to achieve compliance. This section is an auditor's directive.**

* **Specific Missing Evidence Required:**
    * Missing documentation of additional training activities for new hires, including dates, content, and completion confirmations.
* **Specific Non-Compliant Evidence Required Correction:**
    * None identified as directly non-compliant, but additional evidence is required for full compliance.
* **Required Human Action Steps:**
    * HR personnel to gather all documentation related to additional training activities for the past quarter and ensure they are stored in the HR management system.
* **Next Steps for Re-Audit:** Once the missing documentation is gathered, please submit it for re-evaluation within 30 days.
