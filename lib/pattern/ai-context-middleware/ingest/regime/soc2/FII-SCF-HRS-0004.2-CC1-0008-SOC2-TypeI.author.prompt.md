You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : CC1-0008 (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0004.2). 

The policy must follow this structure:

## Introduction
- Clearly state the purpose of the policy regarding Continued Professional Education Training for employees.

## Policy Statement
- Define the organization's commitment to ensuring all employees meet the training requirements.

## Scope
- Explicitly define the scope to include all employees, contractors, and relevant third-party vendors involved in the training process.

## Responsibilities
- Define specific, task-level duties (using **Action Verbs + Frequency**) for roles such as HR, Compliance Officer, and Department Managers.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. REQUIREMENT:
   - Clearly explain the training requirement for employees.
2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - Suggest automated methods for verifying training completion, such as integrating with Learning Management Systems (LMS) to collect completion data.
3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
   - Describe human actions required, such as managers signing off on training completion logs and uploading them to Surveilr with relevant metadata.

## Verification Criteria
- Establish clear measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to **KPIs/SLAs** defined in the previous section.

## Exceptions
- Outline any exceptions to the training requirement and the process for documenting them.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- Detail the **Data Retention** periods for training records (e.g., 'retain for 3 years') and the **Annual Review** frequency of this policy.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- Require workforce member acknowledgement/attestation of understanding and compliance, and specify the need for comprehensive audit logging of training activities.

### References
- Provide any relevant external references, using the format: [Link Text](URL). If no external references exist, state "None."

Ensure that no References subsections appear within individual policy sections, and that the document ends with exactly ONE References section. Emphasize that all keywords must be in **BOLD**: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.
