# European Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) Compliance Context Summary

## What is the European Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)
- **Regulation Type**: Binding EU regulation (not just a framework)
- **Scope**: Covers every "product with digital elements" from consumer IoT to enterprise SaaS
- **Requirements**: Mandatory cybersecurity obligations across the entire product lifecycle
- **Market Impact**: Required for market access in European Union

## CRA vs SOC2 Comparison

### Similarities (Shared Foundation)
- Governance & Access Control requirements
- Operational discipline and documentation

### Key Differences
| Aspect | SOC2 | CRA |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Focus** | Organization-Centric | Product-Centric |
| **Purpose** | Audit Attestation | Regulatory Market Access |
| **Scope** | Internal controls and processes | Product lifecycle cybersecurity |

**Key Insight**: "SOC 2 is strong. CRA goes further." Organizations with SOC2 have a foundation but need additional product-centric compliance.

## Opsfolio's CRA Solution: Compliance-as-Code

### Core Philosophy
- **"Security Outcomes > Checkbox Compliance"**
- **"Pipelines and automation"** instead of traditional "binders and reports"
- **Continuous, code-driven process** rather than periodic assessments

### Technology Stack for CRA
1. **surveilr**: Evidence, telemetry, and provenance collection
2. **Qualityfolio**: QA/SRE assurance mapped to controls
3. **Fleetfolio**: Asset, identity, and SBOM intelligence
4. **NUP**: Governance and lifecycle documentation

**Output**: CRA Conformity File backed by automated evidence

## CRA Compliance Implementation Path

### Step-by-Step Process (Building on SOC2 Foundation)
1. **Map SOC 2 artifacts to CRA Annex I** - Leverage existing SOC 2 foundations
2. **Stand up SBOM pipelines in Fleetfolio** - Automate supply chain transparency
3. **Establish PSIRT & public VDP** - Meet vulnerability disclosure requirements
4. **Codify SDL secure-by-default proof in NUP** - Embed security in development lifecycle
5. **Define lifecycle/EOL commitments** - Plan product support obligations
6. **Automate conformity file creation with surveilr** - Generate CRA compliance documentation
7. **Pilot CRA self-assessment** - Validate compliance readiness
8. **Scale across all products** - Roll out to entire product portfolio

## Key CRA Requirements Addressed

### Product Lifecycle Security
- **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)**: Secure-by-default development practices
- **Supply Chain Transparency**: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) automation
- **Vulnerability Management**: Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) and Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)
- **End-of-Life Planning**: Product support and lifecycle commitment documentation

### Compliance Documentation
- **Conformity File**: Automated generation of required CRA documentation
- **Evidence Collection**: Automated gathering from development workflows
- **Audit Trail**: Complete lifecycle documentation and provenance tracking
- **Self-Assessment**: Validation tools for compliance readiness

## Value Proposition for EU Market Access
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet mandatory EU cybersecurity requirements
- **Market Access**: Enable legal sale of digital products in EU market
- **Automated Process**: Continuous compliance vs periodic manual efforts
- **SOC2 Integration**: Build upon existing SOC2 investments
- **Engineering-First**: Compliance integrated into software development lifecycle
