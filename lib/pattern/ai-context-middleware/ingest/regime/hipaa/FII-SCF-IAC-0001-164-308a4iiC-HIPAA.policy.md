## Introduction

This policy establishes the requirements for implementing and maintaining access authorization policies to ensure that user rights to workstations, transactions, programs, and processes are effectively managed. By leveraging machine attestability and defining human attestation processes, this policy aims to maximize compliance with control code 164.308(a)(4)(ii)(C) and enhance organizational security.

## Policy Statement

The organization is committed to implementing and maintaining robust access authorization policies that are documented, reviewed, and modified as necessary. These policies will govern user access to workstations, transactions, programs, and processes in compliance with regulatory standards and best practices.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who require access to the organization's systems, including:
- **Cloud-hosted systems**
- **SaaS applications**
- **Third-party vendor systems**

## Responsibilities

- **IT Security Team**: Ensure the implementation of access authorization policies, perform regular reviews, and maintain documentation.
- **Managers**: Validate user access rights and document changes as needed.
- **Compliance Officer**: Oversee policy adherence and prepare reports for management review.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**: Implement access authorization policies that are documented and reviewed regularly.
   
   2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: 
   - Use automated tools to generate access logs and user permission reports on a monthly basis.
   - Implement a centralized identity and access management (IAM) system to track and manage user access.

   3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: 
   - Managers will sign an access authorization review document quarterly, detailing any changes made to user rights and reasons for changes.
   - Documented access reviews will be ingested into Surveilr for compliance tracking.

## Verification Criteria

- **Compliance with access authorization policies** will be measured against Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as:
  - 100% of access authorization reviews completed on a quarterly basis.
  - 0 unauthorized access incidents reported within the review period.

## Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the IT Security Team. Exceptions will be reviewed annually to assess their continued necessity and to ensure they do not introduce undue risk.

## Lifecycle Requirements

- Documentation related to access authorization must be retained for a minimum of **five years**.
- This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **annually** or as significant changes occur in the regulatory landscape or organizational structure.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

- All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through a formal training session and documentation.
- Comprehensive audit logs will be maintained to track all access authorization changes and reviews.
- Any exceptions must be formally documented and reviewed.
