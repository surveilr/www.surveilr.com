# Risk Analysis Compliance Policy

## Introduction
Conducting a thorough risk analysis is essential for ensuring compliance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Guidelines. This process aids organizations in identifying potential vulnerabilities and threats to electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), allowing for the implementation of appropriate safeguards to protect sensitive data. The importance of this analysis extends beyond compliance; it fosters a culture of security and preparedness that is critical in today’s digital landscape.

## Policy Statement
The organization is committed to performing a comprehensive risk analysis in accordance with NIST Guidelines to safeguard ePHI and ensure compliance with applicable regulations. This commitment reflects our dedication to protecting the privacy and security of our stakeholders.

## Scope
This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments that handle ePHI, including but not limited to:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: quarterly policy approval; ensure adherence to risk analysis requirements.
- **IT Security**: daily log review; implement and monitor security measures.
- **Risk Management Team**: bi-annual risk analysis execution; report findings to the Compliance Officer.
- **Department Managers**: annual review of departmental risk assessments; ensure staff training on risk awareness.
- **Incident Response Team**: immediate action on identified risks; update the Incident Response Plan as necessary.

These roles are interconnected with the organization’s Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, and Sanction Policy for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

## Evidence Collection Methods
1. **REQUIREMENT**:
   The control requirement mandates that a risk analysis be conducted in accordance with NIST Guidelines to identify and mitigate risks to ePHI.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**:
   - Utilize OSquery to validate security configurations and system integrity.
   - Implement API integrations to verify access controls and ensure that only authorized users have access to ePHI.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**:
   - Managers must certify the completion of the risk analysis for their respective departments.
   - Document the attestation in Surveilr, ensuring that all certifications are logged with timestamps for accountability.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance will be validated using the following SMART objectives and KPIs/SLAs:
- **Specific**: All departments must complete risk analysis within the specified timeframe.
- **Measurable**: Achieve a completion rate of 100% for risk analyses conducted.
- **Achievable**: Ensure resources are allocated for risk assessment tools and training.
- **Relevant**: Align risk analysis findings with organizational security goals.
- **Time-bound**: Complete risk analysis within 30 days of the scheduled date.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and approved by the Compliance Officer. Justifications for exceptions should be clearly stated and retained for review.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: Evidence and logs must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- **Policy Review**: This policy must be reviewed and updated at least annually.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to their understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions, and formal documentation will be required for any exceptions.
