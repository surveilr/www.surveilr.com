# Security Management Policy for Control 164.308(a)(1)(i)

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a robust security management process to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations. This aligns with the requirements set forth in Control 164.308(a)(1)(i) and is essential for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational data, especially within cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

## Policy Statement
This policy mandates the implementation of comprehensive policies and procedures to manage security violations effectively. All employees and associated third-party vendors must adhere to these guidelines to ensure compliance and enhance the organization's security posture.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors with access to the organization's information systems.
- All environments, including on-premises, cloud-hosted systems, and SaaS applications.
- All systems that process, store, or transmit sensitive data.

## Responsibilities
- **Security Officer**: 
  - **Develop** and **review** security policies on an **Annual Review** basis.
  - **Oversee** compliance audits every quarter.
  
- **IT Department**:
  - **Implement** machine attestation methods for security violations on a daily basis.
  - **Monitor** and **report** any anomalies immediately.

- **Employees**:
  - **Complete** security training upon hire and **annually thereafter**.
  - **Report** security incidents within 24 hours of detection.

- Enable alerts for unauthorized access attempts through Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
- Conduct bi-annual training sessions; document attendance and provide certificates of completion.
- Maintain a log of reported incidents and responses, stored in Surveilr for review.

### 1. REQUIREMENT:
Detect security violations promptly.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
- Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) that generate alerts and reports on potential breaches.
- Schedule automated scans of systems for vulnerabilities on a weekly basis.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:
- Security personnel must perform weekly manual checks on critical systems and document findings in Surveilr.

### 1. REQUIREMENT:
Contain and correct security violations.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
- Use automated containment protocols that isolate compromised systems within 5 minutes of detection.
- Implement automated patch management updates, tracked through a centralized dashboard.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTation:
- Incident response teams must conduct post-incident reviews within 48 hours, documenting lessons learned and corrective actions in Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
To ensure compliance with this policy, the following **SMART** criteria will be employed:
- At least 90% of security training completions documented and verified within 30 days of the training period.
- All unauthorized access incidents must be contained within 5 minutes, tracked through logs in Surveilr.
- Quarterly audits must reveal a maximum of 2% non-compliance in security incident reporting.

## Exceptions
- Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and submitted to the Security Officer for approval. 
- Exceptions must include a justification and a remediation plan with a defined timeline for resolution, which should not exceed 30 days.

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All evidence and logs must be retained for a minimum of 2 years.
- The policy must undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its relevance and effectiveness, with updates made as necessary.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
- All workforce members must acknowledge and attest to understanding and compliance with this policy upon onboarding and during annual refresher training.
- Comprehensive audit logs for all critical actions must be maintained in Surveilr, including access to sensitive data and incident responses.
- Document all exceptions and maintain records for compliance purposes.
