# Policy for Control 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(A) - Authorization and Supervision of Employees Working with EPHI

## Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish procedures for the **authorization** and/or **supervision** of employees who work with Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) or in locations where it might be accessed. This policy ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and the protection of sensitive information through clear guidelines and automated evidence collection methods.

## Policy Statement
This policy mandates that all employees who have access to EPHI are properly authorized and supervised. The organization will implement both machine attestation methods and human verification processes to ensure compliance with this control. Regular assessments will be conducted to validate that authorization procedures are followed and that supervisory measures are in place.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to EPHI across all environments, including on-premises systems, cloud-hosted environments, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems. The policy encompasses physical and electronic access to EPHI.

## Responsibilities
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - Ensure that all policies and procedures are updated and compliant with regulations.
  - Oversee the **Annual Review** of this policy.
  
- **HR Department**: 
  - Conduct background checks and verify qualifications of personnel with access to EPHI prior to granting access.
  
- **IT Security Team**: 
  - Implement machine attestation methods for monitoring access and supervision of EPHI.
  - Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with established policies.
  
- **Supervisors**: 
  - Monitor employee activities related to EPHI access and report any violations.
  - Conduct training sessions on EPHI handling procedures.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**: Authorization and Supervision Procedures for EPHI Access
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Use OSquery to collect logs of user access attempts and supervisory checks. Implement API integrations with HR systems to validate personnel qualifications and access rights.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Supervisors must maintain a log of daily supervision activities, including specific actions taken to monitor EPHI access. These logs must be submitted weekly to the Compliance Officer for ingestion into Surveilr.

2. **REQUIREMENT**: Regular Review and Update of Access Permissions
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Schedule automated reports via the identity management system to review access permissions every month.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Conduct quarterly audits of access logs and submit findings to the Compliance Officer, along with action items for any discrepancies found.

3. **REQUIREMENT**: Training and Awareness Programs
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Track completion rates of EPHI handling training through the Learning Management System (LMS) and generate monthly reports.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Maintain signed acknowledgment forms from employees confirming their understanding of EPHI policies, with forms submitted to HR for record-keeping.

## Verification Criteria
Compliance with this policy will be measured against the following **SMART** criteria:
- **100%** of employees with access to EPHI must have completed training within 30 days of hire (KPI).
- **Monthly** reports on access logs must show that **99%** of access attempts are supervised (SLA).
- **Quarterly** reviews must demonstrate that access permissions are correct and up-to-date **within 5 business days** of the review (KPI).

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be documented and formally approved by the Compliance Officer. All exceptions must include justification and will be subject to **Annual Review**. 

## Lifecycle Requirements
- **Data Retention**: All logs and records related to EPHI access and supervision must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**.
- This policy will undergo an **Annual Review** to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

## Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge understanding and compliance with this policy. Comprehensive audit logging will be maintained for all critical actions associated with EPHI access. Exceptions must be formally documented and reviewed during the **Annual Review** process.
