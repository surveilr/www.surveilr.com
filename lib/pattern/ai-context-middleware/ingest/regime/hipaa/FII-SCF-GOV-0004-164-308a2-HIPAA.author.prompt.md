You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 164.308(a)(2) (FII: FII-SCF-GOV-0004, FII-SCF-HRS-0003). 

The policy must follow this exact structure: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. Each section should be formatted with H2 headings (##) and include:

1. **Control Requirement**: Clearly explain the security responsibility assigned to the security official for the development and implementation of policies and procedures.

2. **Machine Attestation Methods**: Suggest practical, automatable methods for collecting evidence, such as using OSquery for configuration details or API integrations for access controls.

3. **Human Attestation Methods**: Where automation is impractical, specify verifiable actions a human must perform, including signatures on reports and documentation methods.

The policy must prioritize **machine attestability** by providing concrete examples of automated evidence collection and validation for each requirement. Additionally, include explicit human attestation steps when needed, detailing the action, artifact, and how it will be ingested into Surveilr.

Ensure the following:
- Use **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions for all processes.
- Clearly define the policy's scope to include **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels** used to handle ePHI.
- In the Responsibilities section, define **specific task-level duties** for each role using **Action Verb + Frequency** language.
- Detail **minimum data retention periods** and **mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.
- Require workforce member acknowledgment and comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions.
- Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullets, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
- End the document with exactly one **References** section, using [Link Text](URL) format for any external references, or state "None" if there are no references.

Ensure that keywords such as **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are **bolded** in the text. The policy document must conclude at the **References** section with no additional content.
