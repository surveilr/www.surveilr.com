## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, fostering a culture of security awareness is paramount to safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. This policy outlines the framework for implementing a comprehensive security awareness and training program for all workforce members, including management, as mandated by the control requirement.

## Policy Statement

It is the policy of [Organization Name] to implement a robust security awareness and training program that educates all workforce members about security risks and best practices. This program aims to enhance the overall security posture of the organization and ensure compliance with control 164.308(a)(5)(i). The effectiveness of this program will be continuously assessed through both **machine attestation methods** and **human attestation methods**.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to [Organization Name]'s information systems and data. It encompasses all aspects of security awareness training, including regular updates, specialized training sessions, and evaluation processes.

## Responsibilities

- **IT Security Team**: Tasked with the technical implementation of training tools and monitoring compliance.
- **All Workforce Members**: Required to complete training and apply learned best practices in their daily activities.

## Evidence Collection Methods

To ensure compliance and facilitate machine attestability, the following methods will be employed:

- **Learning Management System (LMS)**: Utilize an LMS to track training completion rates. The LMS will automatically ingest this data into Surveilr to provide real-time compliance metrics.
- **Automated Survey Distribution**: Post-training surveys will be automatically distributed and analyzed to gauge understanding and retention of training materials.

## Verification Criteria

Verification of compliance will be based on the following **KPIs/SLAs**:

- **Training Completion Rate**: 100% of workforce members must complete the training within 30 days of onboarding or annual refreshers.
- **Survey Response Rate**: A minimum of 75% of participants must complete post-training surveys.
- **Knowledge Retention Score**: An average score of 80% or higher on assessments following training sessions.

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy may only be granted by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) under extraordinary circumstances. All exceptions must be documented and reviewed annually to determine if they remain valid.

## Lifecycle Requirements

The security awareness and training program will adhere to the following lifecycle requirements:

- **Initial Training**: All new hires must complete the training within 30 days of employment.
- **Annual Refresher Training**: All workforce members must complete refresher training annually.
- **Training Content Review**: Training materials will be reviewed and updated at least once per year to incorporate emerging threats and compliance changes.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

Documentation of training participation, completion rates, and evaluation outcomes will be maintained and made available for audit purposes. The Training Manager will ensure that:

- All training logs are uploaded to Surveilr with relevant metadata, including reviewer name, date, and training outcomes.
- An **Annual Review** of the training program is conducted to assess effectiveness and compliance with control requirements.
