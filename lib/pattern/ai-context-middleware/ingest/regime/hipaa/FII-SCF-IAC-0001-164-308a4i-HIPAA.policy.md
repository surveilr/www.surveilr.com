# Information Access Management Policy

## Introduction
This policy outlines the procedures and protocols for authorizing access to Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI) in accordance with the requirements of **164.308(a)(4)(i)**. The goal is to ensure that access to EPHI is controlled and monitored to prevent unauthorized access while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors (Business Associates) who require access to EPHI across all environments, including:
- Cloud-hosted systems
- SaaS applications
- Third-party vendor systems

## Responsibilities
- **Information Security Officer (ISO)**: 
  - Conduct **annual reviews** of access rights to EPHI.
  - Ensure documentation of all access requests and approvals.
  - Oversee compliance with access control policies.
  
- **IT Department**: 
  - Implement and maintain access control systems.
  - Conduct bi-annual audits of access logs.
  - Respond to access request inquiries within 48 hours.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT:** Authorization of access to EPHI must be documented and reviewed regularly.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Automated logging of access requests and approvals via an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Workforce members must submit signed access request forms, which will be scanned and uploaded to Surveilr.

2. **REQUIREMENT:** Periodic review of access rights to ensure compliance.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Automated alerts generated by the IAM system for accounts that have not been reviewed within the designated timeframe.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** ISO must document the results of annual access reviews in a formal report for ingestion into Surveilr.

3. **REQUIREMENT:** Training on access management policies.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION:** Training completion is tracked through an online learning management system (LMS).
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION:** Employees must sign a training acknowledgment form that is submitted to HR and stored in Surveilr.

## Verification Criteria
- Compliance will be measured by the following **KPIs/SLAs**:
  - 100% of access requests must be logged and approved within 48 hours.
  - 95% of access rights reviews must occur within the **annual review** timeframe.
  - 100% participation in quarterly training sessions.

## Exceptions
Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and approved by the ISO. An exception report must be generated and submitted to Surveilr within 24 hours of the exception occurrence.

## Lifecycle Requirements
