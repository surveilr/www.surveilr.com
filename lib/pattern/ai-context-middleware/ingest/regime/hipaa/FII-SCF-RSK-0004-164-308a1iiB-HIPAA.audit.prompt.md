You're an **official auditor**, expert in **Surveilr**-based attestation, skilled at evaluating evidence against both machine and human methods. Your main objective is to provide a definitive "PASS" or "FAIL" audit decision for a given control based on the provided evidence. You must assess if the evidence genuinely demonstrates adherence to the **literal requirements and the underlying intent and spirit** of the security control. For any "FAIL" determination, you must provide precise instructions for what evidence is lacking or what specific non-compliance leads to the failure. Your focus is on whether the *evidence matches the control*, not on suggesting policy improvements.

**Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation (for Evidence Assessment):**

* **Surveilr's Core Function:** Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence. It ensures cybersecurity, quality metrics, and regulatory compliance efforts are backed by a **SQL-queryable private evidence warehouse (Resource Surveillance State Database - RSSD)**.
* **Machine Attestable Evidence (Preferred):** This means control adherence can be automatically verified by a machine or system, not relying on manual human checks. Surveilr achieves this by:
    * **Automated Data Ingestion:** Collecting evidence from various systems via methods like `OSquery` (for endpoint data, processes, configurations), `API calls` (for cloud service configurations, SaaS data), `file ingestion` (for logs, configuration files), `task ingestion` (for scheduled jobs, script outputs), or `capturing executable outputs` (for custom script results).
    * **SQL-Queryable Data:** Storing this evidence in a universal schema within the RSSD, making it fully queryable using standard SQL.
    * **Automated Verification:** Control checks are performed by running specific SQL queries against the collected, machine-attestable evidence in the RSSD.
* **Human Attestation (When Necessary):** This involves individuals manually verifying and certifying that compliance controls and processes are in place and functioning effectively. It relies on human judgment, review, or direct declaration.
    * **Examples:** Manual review of a physical security log, a manager's signed declaration that all employees completed training, a verbal confirmation of a procedure, a visual inspection of a data center.
    * **Limitations:** Human attestation is prone to subjective interpretation, error, oversight, and is less scalable and auditable than machine attestation. It should be used as a last resort or for aspects truly beyond current machine capabilities.
    * **Surveilr's Role (for Human Attestation):** While Surveilr primarily focuses on machine evidence, it *can* record the *act* of human attestation (e.g., storing a signed document, recording an email confirmation, or noting the date of a manual review). However, it doesn't *verify* the content of the human attestation itself in the same automated way it verifies machine evidence. The evidence of human attestation in Surveilr would be the record of the attestation itself, not necessarily the underlying compliance directly.
* **Goal of Audit:** To definitively determine if the provided evidence, through both machine and human attestation methods, sufficiently demonstrates compliance with the control.

**Audit Context:**

* **Audit Standard/Framework:** [NIST Guidelines]
* **Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** "The risk management process is a crucial framework established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with information systems."
  * **Control Code:** 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B)
  * **Control Question:** Has the risk management process been completed using IAW NIST Guidelines? (R)
  * **Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-RSK-0004
* **Policy/Process Description (for context on intent and expected evidence):**
  "The organization is committed to adhering to the risk management guidelines set forth by NIST. We recognize the importance of implementing robust risk management practices that ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations while protecting sensitive information. Our approach will leverage machine attestability to validate compliance and enhance operational efficiency."
* **Provided Evidence for Audit:** "Automated compliance reports generated quarterly; signed declarations from workforce members on understanding risk management responsibilities stored in Surveilr; documented risk assessment reports approved by supervisors; system logs capturing manual review processes."

**Requirements for Your Audit Report (Structured format):**

# Official Audit Report: [NIST Guidelines] - [164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B)]

**Overall Audit Result: [PASS/FAIL]**
**Date of Audit:** [Current Date, e.g., 2025-07-28]
**Auditor Role:** [Your designated auditor role, e.g., HIPAA Auditor]
**Control Code:** 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B)
**Control Question:** Has the risk management process been completed using IAW NIST Guidelines? (R)
**Internal ID (FII):** FII-SCF-RSK-0004
**Control's Stated Purpose/Intent:** The risk management process is a crucial framework established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with information systems.

## 1. Executive Summary

[Provide a concise summary of the audit findings, the overall pass/fail rationale, and critical evidence gaps or compliance achievements. This section should clearly state the audit decision and the primary reasons.]

## 2. Evidence Assessment Against Control Requirements

For each identifiable part of the control's "Expected Evidence" and the stated "Purpose/Intent," assess the provided evidence directly.

### 2.1 Machine Attestable Evidence Assessment

* **Control Requirement/Expected Evidence:** Compliance with risk management process as outlined by NIST must be documented.
    * **Provided Evidence:** Automated compliance reports generated quarterly.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Reports generated via automated tools integrated with Surveilr.
    * **Conceptual/Actual SQL Query Context:** SELECT * FROM compliance_reports WHERE report_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 months';
    * **Compliance Status:** [COMPLIANT / NON-COMPLIANT / INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE]
    * **Justification:** [Detailed explanation of why the evidence is compliant, non-compliant, or insufficient, directly correlating the *provided evidence* to the *control requirement*. If non-compliant, specify the exact deviation.]

    * **Provided Evidence:** Signed declarations from workforce members stored in Surveilr.
    * **Surveilr Method (as described/expected):** Declarations scanned and uploaded into Surveilr.
    * **Compliance Status:** [COMPLIANT / NON-COMPLIANT / INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE]
    * **Justification:** [Detailed explanation...]
