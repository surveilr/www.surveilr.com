# Policy Document for Control 164.308(a)(3)(i) (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0008)

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this policy is to establish a framework for ensuring that all members of the workforce have appropriate access to electronic protected health information (EPHI) while preventing unauthorized access. This policy aligns with regulatory requirements and promotes the integrity and confidentiality of EPHI within our organization.

## 2. Policy Statement
Our organization is committed to safeguarding EPHI by implementing robust workforce security measures. We will ensure that access to EPHI is restricted to authorized personnel only and that all access is monitored and auditable. We uphold the principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in our management of EPHI.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all workforce members, including employees, contractors, and third-party vendors, across all environments where EPHI is created, received, maintained, or transmitted. This includes but is not limited to cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **HR Department**: **Conduct** workforce role assessments **annually** to determine access needs to EPHI.
- **IT Security Team**: **Review** access control measures **quarterly** to ensure alignment with policy requirements.
- **Compliance Officer**: **Audit** workforce access to EPHI **semi-annually** and report findings to management.
- **All Workforce Members**: **Acknowledge** and **attest** to understanding the policy **upon hire** and **annually thereafter**.

## 5. Evidence Collection Methods
### 1. REQUIREMENT
The organization must implement policies and procedures to ensure appropriate access to EPHI and prevent unauthorized access.

### 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION
Utilize tools such as OSquery to automate the collection of access logs, verifying that only authorized personnel have access to EPHI. Schedule automated checks to run **weekly** to validate access controls.

### 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION
Workforce members must complete an attestation form documenting their understanding and compliance with this policy. These forms should be submitted **annually** and maintained in a secure repository for verification.

## 6. Verification Criteria
Compliance will be measured through **KPIs** such as:
- Percentage of workforce members with documented access roles (target: 100%).
- Frequency of compliance audits resulting in non-conformance (target: less than 5% annually).
- Timeliness of access control reviews (target: completed within 10 days of scheduled date).

## 7. Exceptions
Exceptions to this policy may be granted under specific circumstances, such as temporary access needs for project work. Requests for exceptions must be submitted in writing to the Compliance Officer and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

## 8. Lifecycle Requirements
Evidence and logs regarding workforce access to EPHI must be retained for a minimum of **6 years**. This policy will be reviewed and updated at least **annually** to ensure ongoing compliance and relevance.

## 9. Formal Documentation and Audit
All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy through a formal attestation process. Comprehensive audit logging must be maintained for all critical actions related to EPHI access. All exceptions must be formally documented and approved.
