You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D) (FII: FII-SCF-RSK-0004). 

The policy must include the following structure and adhere to all specified guidelines:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the policy's purpose and importance.
2. **Policy Statement**: Clearly articulate the policy's intent and commitment to compliance.
3. **Scope**: Explicitly define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.
4. **Responsibilities**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, using **Action Verb + Frequency** format. Link to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery actions.
5. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Include numbered subheadings for each requirement:
   - 1. REQUIREMENT: Explain the control requirement.
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION: Suggest practical, automatable methods for evidence collection.
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION: Describe precise steps, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr.
6. **Verification Criteria**: Establish clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**.
7. **Exceptions**: Outline how exceptions will be documented and approved.
8. **Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum **Data Retention** periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for **Annual Review** of the policy.
9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for exceptions.
10. **References**: End the document with a single **References** section formatted in the [Link Text](URL) style.

Ensure that:
- The policy maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance in every section.
- All operational details are **SMART**, with bulleted lists of **3-5 operational steps** and specific time-bound metrics.
- The document uses standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.
- The keywords **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** are explicitly **BOLD** in the text.
- There is exactly ONE **References** section at the end of the document, and nothing else follows this section.

Please begin writing the policy document as instructed.
