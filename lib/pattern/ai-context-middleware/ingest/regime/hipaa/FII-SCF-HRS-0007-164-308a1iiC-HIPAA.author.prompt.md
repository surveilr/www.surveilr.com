You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C) (FII: FII-SCF-HRS-0007). 

The policy document must include the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy MUST consist of the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**.

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, and provide a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Clearly define the scope to include ALL relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems,** and **all channels** used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation**: When automation is impractical, define the exact action, artifact, and method for ingestion into Surveilr.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section MUST define **specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency)** for each role mentioned. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require **Workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, **Comprehensive audit logging** for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

9. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

10. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

11. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the **KPIs/SLAs** defined.

12. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

13. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

14. **References Section**: End with a **single** ### References section. If external references exist, list them; if none exist, output "None". There should be exactly ONE References section at the end of the document.

15. **Keyword Emphasis**: Explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

Make sure the policy document ends at the References section with no additional content.
