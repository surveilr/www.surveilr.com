## Introduction

The risk management process is a crucial framework established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with information systems. This process involves a systematic approach to managing risk, ensuring that organizations can safeguard their assets, comply with regulations, and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

## Policy Statement

The organization is committed to adhering to the risk management guidelines set forth by NIST. We recognize the importance of implementing robust risk management practices that ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations while protecting sensitive information. Our approach will leverage machine attestability to validate compliance and enhance operational efficiency.

## Scope

This policy applies to all organizational entities and environments, including:

- Cloud-hosted systems
- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications
- Third-party vendor systems
- All channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI

## Responsibilities

- **Risk Management Team**: Conduct risk assessments quarterly, document findings, and initiate remediation actions.
- **IT Security Team**: Implement security controls within 30 days of risk assessment completion and perform system vulnerability scans bi-monthly.
- **Compliance Officer**: Review and approve risk management policies annually; escalate critical risks to executive management within 5 business days.
- **All Workforce Members**: Complete annual training on risk management procedures and report potential risks within 24 hours of identification.

## Evidence Collection Methods

1. **REQUIREMENT**: Compliance with risk management process as outlined by NIST must be documented.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Utilize automated tools to generate compliance reports and logs of risk assessments.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Require workforce members to sign a declaration confirming their understanding of risk management responsibilities, which will be stored in Surveilr.

2. **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: Automated checks must confirm that risk assessment reports are generated and stored within a secure repository.
   - **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Supervisors must review and approve the reports, with documented approval stored in Surveilr.

3. **HUMAN ATTESTATION**: Manual checks must be documented and verified by a designated reviewer after each risk assessment cycle.
   - **MACHINE ATTESTATION**: System logs must capture the manual review process and maintain a history of all approvals.

## Verification Criteria

- All risk assessments must be completed and documented within the designated timeframe (quarterly).
- Compliance reports must show at least 95% adherence to established risk management protocols.
- Evidence of training completion must be available for all workforce members annually.

## Exceptions

Requests for exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and submitted to the Compliance Officer for approval. All exceptions must be reviewed quarterly and must include a justification for the deviation from the policy.

## Lifecycle Requirements

- **Data Retention**: All evidence/logs must be retained for a minimum of 6 years.
- **Policy Review Frequency**: This policy must be reviewed and updated annually to reflect any changes in NIST guidelines or organizational practices.

## Formal Documentation and Audit

- All workforce members must acknowledge their understanding and compliance with this policy via an electronic signature.
- Comprehensive audit logging of all critical actions related to risk management must be maintained.
- Any exceptions granted must be formally documented and reviewed during audits.

## Attestation Guidance

### Machine Attestation
- Implement automated logging mechanisms that capture and validate compliance data.
- Utilize cloud-based tools for real-time monitoring and reporting of risk management activities.

### Human Attestation
- Require workforce members to complete a checklist post-training, documenting their understanding of risk management protocols.
- All completed checklists must be ingested into Surveilr, ensuring traceability and accountability.

## Operational Detail and Specificity

- **Containment Actions**:
  - Identify and isolate affected systems within 24 hours of a risk being identified.
  - Notify the Risk Management Team of containment measures taken within 48 hours.
  - Document all actions taken in the incident response log.

- **Correction Actions**:
  - Implement corrective measures within 30 days of risk identification.
  - Schedule a follow-up review to ensure corrections are effective within 14 days post-implementation.
  - Update relevant documentation to reflect changes in risk status.

## Compliance Focus

This policy emphasizes maximizing machine attestability to ensure compliance with NIST guidelines. Each section includes attestation guidance, and failure to provide such methods will result in non-compliance.
