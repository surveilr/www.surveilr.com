You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control : 164.308(a)(1)(i) (FII: FII-SCF-GOV-0001, FII-SCF-GOV-0002). 

Please follow these instructions:

1. Structure the policy with the following mandatory sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**.

2. Each section must include:
   - An explanation of the control requirement.
   - Suggested machine attestation methods, emphasizing automation and practical methods for collecting evidence.
   - Suggested human attestation methods where automation is impractical, detailing specific actions, artifacts, and how they will be ingested into Surveilr.

3. Ensure the policy incorporates **SMART** instructions, replacing general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound** actions. For containment, correction, or violation sanction processes, provide a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps, including a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

4. Define the policy's scope comprehensively, covering all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

5. Prioritize machine attestability by providing concrete examples of automated evidence collection and validation for each requirement.

6. Clearly define roles and responsibilities with specific task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) in the Responsibilities section. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan).

7. Include a dedicated subsection for policy Lifecycle Requirements detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

8. Require formal documentation and audit processes, including workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

9. Use the following structure for Evidence Collection Methods:
   - 1. REQUIREMENT:
   - 2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:
   - 3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:

10. Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation in the Verification Criteria section, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

11. Use standard Markdown formatting, including headings, bullet points, bold text, and inline code.

12. Use the format [Link Text](URL) for external references, if applicable.

13. End with a single **References** section, ensuring it is the final section of the document and contains no additional content. If there are no external references, state "None".

14. Ensure to **bold** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review** throughout the policy.

15. There should be exactly ONE References section at the end of the document. 

Please ensure the policy document is clear, robust, and maximizes machine attestability through Surveilr.
