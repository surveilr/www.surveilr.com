You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B) (FII: FII-SCF-RSK-0004). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: 
   - Include the following sections in this order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, and References**.
   - Each section must be clearly defined with H2 headings (##).

2. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the risk management process as outlined by NIST Guidelines.

3. **Policy Statement**: Clearly state the organization's commitment to risk management and compliance with NIST guidelines.

4. **Scope**: Define the scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

5. **Responsibilities**: 
   - Clearly define specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency) for each role involved in the risk management process. 
   - Reference related organizational plans for escalation and recovery/disciplinary action.

6. **Evidence Collection Methods**: 
   - Structure this section with numbered subheadings: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", and "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:". 
   - For each requirement, explain the control requirement, suggest machine attestation methods, and outline human attestation methods when automation is impractical. 

7. **Verification Criteria**: 
   - Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation that are directly tied to the defined KPIs/SLAs.

8. **Exceptions**: Outline the process for requesting and documenting exceptions, including the need for formal approval.

9. **Lifecycle Requirements**: 
   - Detail minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and the mandatory frequency for policy review and updates.

10. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: 
    - Require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

11. **Attestation Guidance**: 
    - For machine attestation, describe practical, automatable methods for evidence collection and validation.
    - For human attestation, detail precise actions, artifacts, and the ingestion process into Surveilr.

12. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Ensure all processes are replaced with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment and correction, along with a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

13. **Compliance Focus**: Policies MUST maximize machine attestability, and every policy section MUST include attestation guidance. Failure to include such methods will result in non-compliance.

14. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.

15. **Prohibited Content**: Do not include SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code within the policy document.

16. **References Section**: End the document with a single "### References" section. This section must be the only one of its kind, listing external references using [Link Text](URL) format, or stating "None" if no external references exist.

Emphasize the importance of following these guidelines meticulously to ensure a 100% compliance score. The policy must conclude at the References section with no additional content, ensuring there is only one References section at the end of the document.
