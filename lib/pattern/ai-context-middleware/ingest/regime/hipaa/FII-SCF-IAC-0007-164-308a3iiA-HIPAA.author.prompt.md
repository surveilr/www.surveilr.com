You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(A) (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0007, FII-SCF-IAC-0007.1). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and guidelines:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must contain the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References**. 

2. **Attestation Guidance**: Each section should:
   - Explain the control requirement.
   - Suggest machine attestation methods, such as collecting data via OSquery or utilizing API integrations.
   - Suggest human attestation methods only when automation is impractical, detailing specific actions and artifacts.

3. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. Include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps for processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, along with a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

4. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to cover all relevant entities and environments, including cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.

5. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: Provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection and validation for each requirement.

6. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed)**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

7. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section must define specific task-level duties for each role, linking to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery actions.

8. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging for critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

10. **PROHIBITED CONTENT**: Focus on describing methods, avoiding SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

11. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Structure this section with numbered subheadings for each requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

12. **Verification Criteria**: Include clear measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

13. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

14. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

15. **References Section**: End with a single section titled ### References. 

16. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

17. Ensure that the policy document ends at the References section with no additional content. There must be exactly ONE References section at the end of the document.

Please begin drafting the policy.
