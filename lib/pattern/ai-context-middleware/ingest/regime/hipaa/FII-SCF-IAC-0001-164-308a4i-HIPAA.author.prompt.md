You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: ). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and requirements to ensure 100% compliance:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit,** and **References**. 

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant,** and **Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, include a **bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps** and a **specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA)**.

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications,** and **third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection and validation.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr when automation is impractical.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: The Responsibilities section must define **specific, task-level duties (action verbs and frequency)** for each role mentioned. Explicitly link to or reference related organizational plans.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include a dedicated subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require **Workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, **Comprehensive audit logging** for all critical actions, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

9. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

10. **Evidence Collection Methods**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

11. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

12. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

13. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

14. **References Section**: End with a single, final **References** section. 

15. **Keyword Emphasis**: The policy text must explicitly use and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

16. The **References section is the FINAL section of the policy document**. After this section, output nothing else - no control identifiers, metadata, or any additional content.

17. **References Section Requirements**: If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by a single line containing "None".

Ensure that the policy document ends at the References section with no additional content and that there is exactly ONE References section at the end of the document.
