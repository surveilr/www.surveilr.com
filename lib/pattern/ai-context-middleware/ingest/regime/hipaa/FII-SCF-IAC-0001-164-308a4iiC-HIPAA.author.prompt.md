You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: ). 

The policy must comply with the following requirements for structure and content:

1. Document Structure: The policy must include the following sections in this order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.**

2. Each section must explain the control requirement, suggest machine attestation methods, and suggest human attestation methods where automation is impractical. 

3. Use Markdown formatting with H2 headings (##) for major requirements, standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms. 

4. Attestation Guidance: For each requirement, detail:
   - **Machine Attestation:** Describe practical methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily").
   - **Human Attestation:** Specify actions, artifacts, and ingestion methods into Surveilr (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report").

5. The policy must contain **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps with a specific time-bound metric (e.g., "contain within 48 hours").

6. Comprehensive Scope Definition: The policy's scope must cover all relevant entities and environments, including **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, and third-party vendor systems.**

7. Prioritize machine attestability and include concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation for each requirement.

8. Define explicit human attestation where necessary, detailing the exact action, artifact, and ingestion into Surveilr.

9. The **Responsibilities** section must define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned, linking to related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan).

10. Policy Lifecycle Requirements must include minimum data retention periods and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

11. Formal Documentation and Audit must require workforce member acknowledgment of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging, and formal documentation of exceptions.

12. Prohibited Content: Do not write or embed SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

13. Use a structured format for Evidence Collection Methods with numbered subheadings: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

14. Verification Criteria must include clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation directly tied to defined **KPIs/SLAs**. 

15. Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code. 

16. Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references in the References section.

17. The References section must be the final section of the policy document. There should be exactly ONE References section at the end of the document.

Emphasize that the policy must maximize machine attestability and adhere to all the outlined specifications to ensure a 100% compliance score. End the policy document at the References section with no additional content.
