You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: "" (FII: ). 

Please follow these detailed instructions to ensure the policy is robust, clear, and achieves a 100% compliance score:

1. **Document Structure:** Use H2 headings (##) for the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.**

2. **Attestation Guidance:** For each section, explain the control requirement, suggest machine attestation methods (e.g., "Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily"), and describe human attestation methods where automation is impractical (e.g., "Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report"). Each section must end with ### References.

3. **Operational Detail and Specificity:** Replace general statements with **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For containment, correction, or violation sanctions, include a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

4. **Comprehensive Scope Definition:** Explicitly define the policy's scope to include all relevant entities and environments such as cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

5. **Prioritize Machine Attestation:** For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.

6. **Explicit Human Attestation:** When human attestation is required, define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.

7. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing:** Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned and explicitly link to related organizational plans (e.g., Incident Response Plan).

8. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements:** Include a subsection detailing **Minimum data retention periods** for evidence/logs and **Mandatory frequency for policy review and update**.

9. **Formal Documentation and Audit:** Require **Workforce member acknowledgement/attestation** of understanding and compliance, along with **Comprehensive audit logging**.

10. **Prohibited Content:** Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries or code blocks.

11. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure:** Use numbered subheadings: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

12. **Verification Criteria:** Define clear measurable criteria for compliance validation tied to the KPIs/SLAs.

13. **Markdown Formatting:** Utilize standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

14. **Hyperlinks:** Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

15. **Keyword Emphasis:** Explicitly use and **BOLD** the keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

16. **References Section:** End the policy document at the References section with no additional content. Ensure there is exactly ONE References section at the end of the document.

17. **References Requirements:** If external references exist, list them under ### References using [Link Text](URL) format. If no external references exist, output "### References" followed by "None".

Ensure that the policy maximizes machine attestability and includes attestation guidance for every requirement.
