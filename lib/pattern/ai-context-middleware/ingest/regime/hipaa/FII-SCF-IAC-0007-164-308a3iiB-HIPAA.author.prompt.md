You are an expert AI policy author specializing in Surveilr-based machine-attestable compliance policies. Your task is to write a policy for Control: 164.308(a)(3)(ii)(B) (FII: FII-SCF-IAC-0007). 

The policy document must adhere to the following structure and requirements:

1. **Document Structure**: The policy must include the following sections in this exact order: **Introduction, Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions, Lifecycle Requirements, Formal Documentation and Audit, References.**

2. **Operational Detail and Specificity**: Ensure that the content includes **Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)** instructions. For processes like containment, correction, or violation sanction, provide a bulleted list of 3-5 operational steps and a specific time-bound metric (KPI/SLA).

3. **Comprehensive Scope Definition**: Explicitly define the policy's scope, covering **cloud-hosted systems, SaaS applications, third-party vendor systems (Business Associates)**, and all channels used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

4. **Prioritize Machine Attestation**: For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation, maximizing machine attestability.

5. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed)**: Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr for human attestation.

6. **Granular Roles and Cross-Referencing**: Define specific, task-level duties for each role mentioned in the Responsibilities section, linking to related organizational plans for escalation and recovery.

7. **Policy Lifecycle Requirements**: Include minimum data retention periods for evidence/logs and mandatory frequency for policy review and update.

8. **Formal Documentation and Audit**: Require workforce member acknowledgment/attestation of understanding and compliance, comprehensive audit logging, and formal documentation for all exceptions.

9. **Prohibited Content**: Focus on describing methods, avoiding the inclusion of SQL queries, code blocks, or pseudo-code.

10. **Evidence Collection Methods Structure**: Use numbered subheadings per requirement with the format: "1. REQUIREMENT:", "2. MACHINE ATTESTATION:", "3. HUMAN ATTESTATION:".

11. **Verification Criteria**: Provide clear, measurable criteria for compliance validation, directly tied to the KPIs/SLAs defined.

12. **Markdown Formatting**: Use standard Markdown formatting including headings, bullets, bold text, and inline code.

13. **Hyperlinks**: Use [Link Text](URL) format for external references.

14. **References Section**: End with a single **### References** section. There must be exactly ONE References section at the end of the document, and no additional content should follow it.

15. **Keyword Emphasis**: Ensure the text explicitly uses and **BOLD** the enforced keywords: **SMART**, **KPIs/SLAs**, **Action Verb + Frequency**, **Data Retention**, and **Annual Review**.

Ensure that the policy document ends at the References section with no additional content and that there is only one References section at the end.
