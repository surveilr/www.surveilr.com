# Opsfolio

## What is Opsfolio and how does it work?

Opsfolio is a compliance automation platform that helps companies pass cybersecurity audits and obtain certifications like SOC2, HIPAA, ISO, CMMC, FedRAMP, and HITRUST. The company combines expert human guidance with AI automation and a "Compliance-as-Code" methodology to deliver guaranteed compliance outcomes rather than just providing software tools.

## Core Value Proposition

Opsfolio positions itself as "More than software. Better than consultants" by offering three integrated services:

1. **Expert-Guided Compliance**: Real compliance engineers provide fractional Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) services, compliance coaching, expert policy authoring, and audit preparation support.
2. **AI-Driven Policy & Evidence Tools**: Intelligent automation that generates compliance evidence from existing workflows, including automated evidence collection, policy generation, gap analysis, and real-time monitoring.
3. **Unified System of Record**: A centralized platform managing all compliance data, policies, controls, and audit trails with unified dashboards and audit readiness scoring.

## Compliance-as-Code Methodology

Opsfolio's distinctive approach treats compliance like software development. Individual Contributors (ICs) such as architects, engineers, QA specialists, and customer success teams can continue their regular work while Opsfolio automatically generates compliance evidence from artifacts they already produce - including code, test results, and customer feedback. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, eliminating duplicate compliance work.

Key features include:

- Code-first compliance evidence generation
- Version-controlled policies treated like code
- Automated evidence collection from development workflows
- Team-centric approach that doesn't disrupt core responsibilities

## Technology Foundation: surveilr

The platform is powered by surveilr, a downloadable single binary that runs securely on Windows, Linux, and macOS within customer infrastructure. This creates a "Compliance Evidence Warehouse" - a SQL-queryable private data warehouse that can operate on laptops with minimal IT support.

surveilr provides:

- Local-first, edge-based evidence collection
- SQL queryable data warehouse
- Private and secure data handling (data stays with the customer)
- Continuous surveillance and evidence collection
- Machine attestable, auditable evidence
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Competitive Differentiation

Compared to traditional compliance tools like Vanta and Drata, Opsfolio offers:

- Compliance-as-Code approach vs. DIY software tools
- Guaranteed compliance outcomes vs. software license with uncertain results
- 60% faster implementation via automated evidence collection
- Fractional CCO support and AI-powered insights vs. documentation and chat support
- Machine attestation where CI/CD pipelines become compliance evidence engines

## Target Market and Results

Opsfolio serves companies needing regulatory compliance certifications, particularly those with engineering-focused teams. The company claims:

- 500+ client companies
- 98% audit pass rate
- Ability to achieve SOC2 Type 2 certification in 2 months
- 60% faster compliance implementation compared to traditional methods

## Business Model

The platform combines human expertise (fractional compliance officers), AI automation for evidence collection and policy generation, and a technical infrastructure (surveilr) that maintains customer data privacy while enabling automated compliance reporting and machine attestation for auditors.

# Opsfolio Auditors Role

## What is the Opsfolio Auditors Role and how does it enhance audit practices?

**Opsfolio's Auditors Role** is a comprehensive partnership program designed for audit firms, compliance consultants, and independent auditors who want to enhance client value while improving operational efficiency. This program focuses on **Enhanced Client Value & Efficiency** by providing auditors with a white-labeled compliance platform that can be offered under their own brand while maintaining existing client relationships and expertise.

## Core Partnership Benefits

**White-Labeled Platform Access**: Auditors can offer Opsfolio's comprehensive compliance platform under their own brand, allowing firms to provide advanced compliance tools to clients while maintaining their established relationships and positioning themselves as technology-forward service providers.

**Significant Audit Efficiency Gains**: The platform provides access to organized, pre-validated evidence packages that reduce audit time by up to 50%, enabling auditors to focus on high-value testing and analysis rather than time-consuming evidence collection and organization activities.

**Continuous Client Engagement**: Support clients between audits with continuous control monitoring and remediation tracking, creating opportunities for increased client retention and recurring revenue streams beyond traditional annual audit engagements.

**Flexible Partnership Models**: Multiple partnership structures available to fit different practice sizes and client needs, from simple referral arrangements to comprehensive white-label implementations.

## Revenue Enhancement Opportunities

**Recurring Revenue Streams**: Partners earn recurring revenue from client subscriptions with a transparent commission structure featuring monthly payouts and detailed reporting, creating predictable income beyond project-based audit fees.

**Expanded Service Offerings**: Ability to offer comprehensive compliance-as-a-service solutions, positioning the firm as a strategic partner rather than just an annual auditor, leading to deeper client relationships and higher lifetime value.

**Market Differentiation**: Access to cutting-edge compliance technology differentiates audit firms from competitors still using traditional manual processes and spreadsheet-based approaches.

## Training and Support Infrastructure

**Comprehensive Certification Program**: Team members receive certification on the Opsfolio platform through regular training sessions, comprehensive documentation, and ongoing technical support to ensure successful implementation and client delivery.

**Marketing and Sales Support**: Access to co-branded marketing materials, case studies, and joint sales presentations to help close more deals and articulate the value proposition to prospective clients.

**Technical Integration Capabilities**: White-labeled platform access includes API integration capabilities and custom branding options for enterprise partners, allowing seamless integration into existing client workflows.

## Target Audience

This partnership program is specifically designed for **CPA firms**, **compliance consulting practices**, **independent auditors**, **risk management consultancies**, and **cybersecurity audit specialists** who serve clients requiring compliance certifications such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, or FedRAMP.

## Implementation Strategy

**Client Value Enhancement**: Transform traditional audit relationships into ongoing compliance partnerships by providing clients with continuous monitoring tools and real-time compliance visibility between formal audit engagements.

**Operational Efficiency**: Leverage automated evidence collection and organization to reduce audit preparation time, allowing auditors to focus on analysis, testing, and advisory services that provide higher value to clients.

**Technology Integration**: Seamlessly integrate compliance automation into existing audit workflows without disrupting established processes or client relationships.

## Measurable Outcomes

Audit firms partnering with Opsfolio typically experience:

- 50% reduction in evidence collection and organization time
- Increased client retention rates through ongoing compliance support
- New recurring revenue streams from subscription-based services
- Enhanced market positioning as technology-forward compliance experts
- Improved audit quality through standardized evidence packages and continuous monitoring

**Partnership Philosophy**: This program transforms traditional audit firms from periodic service providers into continuous compliance partners, enabling them to deliver greater client value while building more profitable, sustainable practice models in an increasingly competitive professional services market.
