# Opsfolio

## What is Opsfolio and how does it work?

Opsfolio is a compliance automation platform that helps companies pass cybersecurity audits and obtain certifications like SOC2, HIPAA, ISO, CMMC, FedRAMP, and HITRUST. The company combines expert human guidance with AI automation and a "Compliance-as-Code" methodology to deliver guaranteed compliance outcomes rather than just providing software tools.

## Core Value Proposition

Opsfolio positions itself as "More than software. Better than consultants" by offering three integrated services:

1. **Expert-Guided Compliance**: Real compliance engineers provide fractional Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) services, compliance coaching, expert policy authoring, and audit preparation support.
2. **AI-Driven Policy & Evidence Tools**: Intelligent automation that generates compliance evidence from existing workflows, including automated evidence collection, policy generation, gap analysis, and real-time monitoring.
3. **Unified System of Record**: A centralized platform managing all compliance data, policies, controls, and audit trails with unified dashboards and audit readiness scoring.

## Compliance-as-Code Methodology

Opsfolio's distinctive approach treats compliance like software development. Individual Contributors (ICs) such as architects, engineers, QA specialists, and customer success teams can continue their regular work while Opsfolio automatically generates compliance evidence from artifacts they already produce - including code, test results, and customer feedback. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, eliminating duplicate compliance work.

Key features include:

- Code-first compliance evidence generation
- Version-controlled policies treated like code
- Automated evidence collection from development workflows
- Team-centric approach that doesn't disrupt core responsibilities

## Technology Foundation: surveilr

The platform is powered by surveilr, a downloadable single binary that runs securely on Windows, Linux, and macOS within customer infrastructure. This creates a "Compliance Evidence Warehouse" - a SQL-queryable private data warehouse that can operate on laptops with minimal IT support.

surveilr provides:

- Local-first, edge-based evidence collection
- SQL queryable data warehouse
- Private and secure data handling (data stays with the customer)
- Continuous surveillance and evidence collection
- Machine attestable, auditable evidence
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Competitive Differentiation

Compared to traditional compliance tools like Vanta and Drata, Opsfolio offers:

- Compliance-as-Code approach vs. DIY software tools
- Guaranteed compliance outcomes vs. software license with uncertain results
- 60% faster implementation via automated evidence collection
- Fractional CCO support and AI-powered insights vs. documentation and chat support
- Machine attestation where CI/CD pipelines become compliance evidence engines

## Target Market and Results

Opsfolio serves companies needing regulatory compliance certifications, particularly those with engineering-focused teams. The company claims:

- 500+ client companies
- 98% audit pass rate
- Ability to achieve SOC2 Type 2 certification in 2 months
- 60% faster compliance implementation compared to traditional methods

## Business Model

The platform combines human expertise (fractional compliance officers), AI automation for evidence collection and policy generation, and a technical infrastructure (surveilr) that maintains customer data privacy while enabling automated compliance reporting and machine attestation for auditors.

# Opsfolio for CTOs

## How does Opsfolio help CTOs and technical leaders with compliance?

Opsfolio provides a developer-friendly compliance automation platform specifically designed for CTOs and technical leaders who need to achieve compliance certifications without disrupting their development workflow or building dedicated compliance teams. The platform integrates directly into existing tech stacks and development processes.

## Core Value Proposition for Technical Leaders

Opsfolio addresses the unique challenges CTOs face when dealing with compliance requirements:

**Build a Trust Layer into Your Stack:** The platform embeds compliance directly into development workflows without slowing down innovation or requiring separate compliance infrastructure.

**60% Faster Time-to-Market:** CTOs can get their products enterprise-ready faster with automated compliance that doesn't require hiring dedicated compliance staff or building internal compliance capabilities.

**Developer-Friendly Integration:** The platform provides APIs, CLI tools, and CI/CD integrations that development teams actually want to use, making compliance a natural part of the development process rather than an external burden.

**Scale Without Hiring:** Access fractional Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) expertise without the overhead, cost, and management complexity of full-time compliance hires.

## Technical Integration and Workflow

Opsfolio's "Compliance-as-Code" methodology is specifically designed for technical environments:

- **Automated Evidence Collection:** The platform automatically gathers compliance evidence from existing development tools, CI/CD pipelines, code repositories, and testing frameworks
- **Real-time Compliance Monitoring:** Continuous surveillance of compliance posture integrated into development workflows
- **Developer Workflow Integration:** Works with existing tools and processes rather than requiring separate compliance workflows
- **Machine Attestable Evidence:** Generates auditable, queryable evidence that can be programmatically verified and reviewed by auditors

## surveilr Technology for Technical Teams

The platform is built on surveilr, a single binary application that runs securely on Windows, Linux, and macOS within existing infrastructure:

- **SQL Queryable Warehouse:** Creates a local compliance evidence warehouse that technical teams can query and analyze using familiar SQL tools
- **Edge-based Data Collection:** Ensures sensitive data stays within the organization's infrastructure while enabling automated compliance reporting
- **Developer-Friendly Architecture:** Single binary deployment that integrates with existing infrastructure without complex setup or external dependencies
- **Version Control Integration:** Treats compliance policies and evidence like code with version control, peer reviews, and automated testing

## Proven Outcomes for CTOs

Technical leaders choosing Opsfolio typically achieve:

- **SOC2 Type 2 certification in 2 months** (compared to 12+ months for DIY approaches)
- **Enterprise sales acceleration** through established trust credentials and compliance certifications
- **Automated evidence collection** from existing development tools and workflows
- **Audit-ready documentation** that passes external audits without manual preparation
- **Real-time compliance posture monitoring** integrated into existing monitoring and alerting systems

## Compliance Frameworks Supported

The platform helps CTOs achieve certifications across multiple frameworks commonly required for enterprise software:

- SOC2 Type I and Type II
- HIPAA (for healthcare-related applications)
- ISO 27001
- CMMC (for government/defense contractors)
- FedRAMP (for federal government software)
- HITRUST (for healthcare technology)

## Business Impact for Technical Organizations

For CTOs, Opsfolio addresses critical business challenges:

- **Removes compliance as a technical debt** by making it part of the development process
- **Enables enterprise sales** by providing the trust credentials large customers require
- **Reduces engineering distraction** by automating compliance evidence collection from existing workflows
- **Provides audit readiness** without requiring engineering teams to manually prepare compliance documentation
- **Scales compliance capabilities** without expanding headcount or creating new organizational complexity

## Integration with Development Practices

The platform works with common development practices and tools:

- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** Compliance checks and evidence collection happen automatically as part of build and deployment processes
- **Code Repository Integration:** Compliance evidence is generated from code commits, pull requests, and repository activity
- **Testing Framework Integration:** Test results and quality metrics automatically contribute to compliance evidence
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Works with containerized applications, cloud infrastructure, and modern deployment practices

This approach allows technical leaders to maintain their focus on product development and innovation while automatically building the compliance foundation needed for enterprise customers and regulatory requirements.
