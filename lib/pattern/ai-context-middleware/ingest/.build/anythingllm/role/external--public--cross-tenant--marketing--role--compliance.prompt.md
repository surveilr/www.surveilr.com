# Opsfolio

## What is Opsfolio and how does it work?

Opsfolio is a compliance automation platform that helps companies pass cybersecurity audits and obtain certifications like SOC2, HIPAA, ISO, CMMC, FedRAMP, and HITRUST. The company combines expert human guidance with AI automation and a "Compliance-as-Code" methodology to deliver guaranteed compliance outcomes rather than just providing software tools.

## Core Value Proposition

Opsfolio positions itself as "More than software. Better than consultants" by offering three integrated services:

1. **Expert-Guided Compliance**: Real compliance engineers provide fractional Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) services, compliance coaching, expert policy authoring, and audit preparation support.
2. **AI-Driven Policy & Evidence Tools**: Intelligent automation that generates compliance evidence from existing workflows, including automated evidence collection, policy generation, gap analysis, and real-time monitoring.
3. **Unified System of Record**: A centralized platform managing all compliance data, policies, controls, and audit trails with unified dashboards and audit readiness scoring.

## Compliance-as-Code Methodology

Opsfolio's distinctive approach treats compliance like software development. Individual Contributors (ICs) such as architects, engineers, QA specialists, and customer success teams can continue their regular work while Opsfolio automatically generates compliance evidence from artifacts they already produce - including code, test results, and customer feedback. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, eliminating duplicate compliance work.

Key features include:

- Code-first compliance evidence generation
- Version-controlled policies treated like code
- Automated evidence collection from development workflows
- Team-centric approach that doesn't disrupt core responsibilities

## Technology Foundation: surveilr

The platform is powered by surveilr, a downloadable single binary that runs securely on Windows, Linux, and macOS within customer infrastructure. This creates a "Compliance Evidence Warehouse" - a SQL-queryable private data warehouse that can operate on laptops with minimal IT support.

surveilr provides:

- Local-first, edge-based evidence collection
- SQL queryable data warehouse
- Private and secure data handling (data stays with the customer)
- Continuous surveillance and evidence collection
- Machine attestable, auditable evidence
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Competitive Differentiation

Compared to traditional compliance tools like Vanta and Drata, Opsfolio offers:

- Compliance-as-Code approach vs. DIY software tools
- Guaranteed compliance outcomes vs. software license with uncertain results
- 60% faster implementation via automated evidence collection
- Fractional CCO support and AI-powered insights vs. documentation and chat support
- Machine attestation where CI/CD pipelines become compliance evidence engines

## Target Market and Results

Opsfolio serves companies needing regulatory compliance certifications, particularly those with engineering-focused teams. The company claims:

- 500+ client companies
- 98% audit pass rate
- Ability to achieve SOC2 Type 2 certification in 2 months
- 60% faster compliance implementation compared to traditional methods

## Business Model

The platform combines human expertise (fractional compliance officers), AI automation for evidence collection and policy generation, and a technical infrastructure (surveilr) that maintains customer data privacy while enabling automated compliance reporting and machine attestation for auditors.

# Opsfolio Compliance Role

## What is the Opsfolio Compliance Role and how does it work?

**Opsfolio's Compliance Role** is a specialized operational framework designed to streamline compliance management for organizations across multiple regulatory frameworks. This role-based approach focuses on **Compliance Operations Excellence** through systematic automation and centralized control management.

## Core Functionality

**Single Source of Truth Management**: Opsfolio maintains a unified repository for all compliance controls across multiple frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), enabling organizations to map controls efficiently and eliminate redundant compliance work.

**Automated Evidence Collection**: The platform establishes automated workflows that continuously gather and organize proof of control effectiveness without requiring manual intervention. This includes automated collection of logs, configurations, policy adherence data, and audit trails.

**Real-Time Compliance Visibility**: Provides instant visibility into organizational compliance posture through comprehensive dashboards that display control status, identify gaps, and prioritize remediation efforts in real-time.

**Continuous Audit Readiness**: The system maintains organizations in a state of perpetual audit readiness by automatically organizing evidence, tracking control effectiveness, and generating compliance reports.

## Key Benefits

- **Efficiency Improvements**: Measurable improvements in compliance efficiency through automation and streamlined processes
- **Risk Reduction**: Proactive identification and remediation of compliance gaps before they become audit findings
- **Resource Optimization**: Elimination of redundant compliance activities across multiple frameworks
- **Audit Preparedness**: Continuous maintenance of audit-ready documentation and evidence

## Target Users

This solution is specifically designed for **compliance teams**, **risk management professionals**, **security officers**, and **audit coordinators** in organizations that must maintain compliance across multiple regulatory frameworks simultaneously.

## Integration and Implementation

Opsfolio integrates with existing organizational systems to automatically collect compliance evidence from various sources including cloud infrastructure, security tools, HR systems, and business applications. The platform maps these data sources to specific control requirements across different compliance frameworks.

## Measurable Outcomes

Organizations using Opsfolio for compliance operations typically see:

- Reduced time spent on manual evidence collection (up to 80% reduction)
- Improved audit outcomes through better preparation and documentation
- Enhanced visibility into compliance posture across the organization
- Streamlined operations that support continuous compliance rather than point-in-time assessments

This role-based approach transforms compliance from a periodic, manual burden into an integrated, automated aspect of daily operations, making compliance a "catalyst for engineering excellence" rather than a roadblock to business objectives.
