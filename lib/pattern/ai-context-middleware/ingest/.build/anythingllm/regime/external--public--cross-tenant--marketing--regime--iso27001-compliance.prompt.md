# Opsfolio

## What is Opsfolio and how does it work?

Opsfolio is a compliance automation platform that helps companies pass cybersecurity audits and obtain certifications like SOC2, HIPAA, ISO, CMMC, FedRAMP, and HITRUST. The company combines expert human guidance with AI automation and a "Compliance-as-Code" methodology to deliver guaranteed compliance outcomes rather than just providing software tools.

## Core Value Proposition

Opsfolio positions itself as "More than software. Better than consultants" by offering three integrated services:

1. **Expert-Guided Compliance**: Real compliance engineers provide fractional Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) services, compliance coaching, expert policy authoring, and audit preparation support.
2. **AI-Driven Policy & Evidence Tools**: Intelligent automation that generates compliance evidence from existing workflows, including automated evidence collection, policy generation, gap analysis, and real-time monitoring.
3. **Unified System of Record**: A centralized platform managing all compliance data, policies, controls, and audit trails with unified dashboards and audit readiness scoring.

## Compliance-as-Code Methodology

Opsfolio's distinctive approach treats compliance like software development. Individual Contributors (ICs) such as architects, engineers, QA specialists, and customer success teams can continue their regular work while Opsfolio automatically generates compliance evidence from artifacts they already produce - including code, test results, and customer feedback. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, eliminating duplicate compliance work.

Key features include:

- Code-first compliance evidence generation
- Version-controlled policies treated like code
- Automated evidence collection from development workflows
- Team-centric approach that doesn't disrupt core responsibilities

## Technology Foundation: surveilr

The platform is powered by surveilr, a downloadable single binary that runs securely on Windows, Linux, and macOS within customer infrastructure. This creates a "Compliance Evidence Warehouse" - a SQL-queryable private data warehouse that can operate on laptops with minimal IT support.

surveilr provides:

- Local-first, edge-based evidence collection
- SQL queryable data warehouse
- Private and secure data handling (data stays with the customer)
- Continuous surveillance and evidence collection
- Machine attestable, auditable evidence
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Competitive Differentiation

Compared to traditional compliance tools like Vanta and Drata, Opsfolio offers:

- Compliance-as-Code approach vs. DIY software tools
- Guaranteed compliance outcomes vs. software license with uncertain results
- 60% faster implementation via automated evidence collection
- Fractional CCO support and AI-powered insights vs. documentation and chat support
- Machine attestation where CI/CD pipelines become compliance evidence engines

## Target Market and Results

Opsfolio serves companies needing regulatory compliance certifications, particularly those with engineering-focused teams. The company claims:

- 500+ client companies
- 98% audit pass rate
- Ability to achieve SOC2 Type 2 certification in 2 months
- 60% faster compliance implementation compared to traditional methods

## Business Model

The platform combines human expertise (fractional compliance officers), AI automation for evidence collection and policy generation, and a technical infrastructure (surveilr) that maintains customer data privacy while enabling automated compliance reporting and machine attestation for auditors.

# Opsfolio ISO 27001 Compliance Solution

## What is Opsfolio's ISO 27001 offering and how does it work?

Opsfolio provides a comprehensive compliance and security management platform specifically designed to help organizations achieve ISO 27001 certification efficiently. ISO 27001 is the international standard for information security management systems (ISMS), and Opsfolio streamlines the entire certification process from initial implementation to ongoing compliance maintenance.

**Key Features of Opsfolio's ISO 27001 Solution:**

Opsfolio's platform automates the complex ISO 27001 compliance process through several core capabilities. The system provides automated evidence collection, continuous monitoring, and risk management tools that systematically address the 114 controls outlined in ISO 27001:2022. Organizations can achieve certification in 6-12 months using Opsfolio's structured approach, compared to traditional methods that often take 18-24 months.

The platform includes pre-built policy templates that align with ISO 27001 requirements, automated audit management capabilities, and real-time compliance monitoring. It integrates seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure to collect evidence automatically, reducing manual documentation efforts by up to 80%. The system also provides gap analysis tools to identify areas requiring attention before formal audits.

**Business Benefits and Compliance Value:**

ISO 27001 certification through Opsfolio opens doors to international business opportunities, as many global organizations require this certification from their vendors and partners. The platform helps organizations meet multiple regulatory requirements simultaneously, including GDPR, NIS2, and other privacy and security regulations, since ISO 27001 provides the foundational framework for many compliance standards.

Organizations using Opsfolio's ISO 27001 solution benefit from systematic risk management, enhanced cyber-resilience, and operational excellence. The platform's continuous monitoring ensures ongoing compliance, not just one-time certification, which is crucial for maintaining the certification and demonstrating continuous improvement to auditors.

**Target Users and Implementation:**

Opsfolio's ISO 27001 solution is ideal for organizations of all sizes, from startups to enterprise companies, particularly those in regulated industries or those seeking to expand into international markets. The platform is designed for use by compliance teams, security professionals, CISOs, and IT administrators who need to implement and maintain information security management systems.

The implementation process is guided and automated, with Opsfolio providing step-by-step guidance, pre-mapped controls, and automated workflows that align with ISO 27001 requirements. The platform supports both first-time certification efforts and ongoing compliance maintenance for organizations already certified.

**Integration and Technical Approach:**

Opsfolio integrates with existing business systems and security tools to provide a centralized compliance management hub. The platform uses automated data collection, policy management, and audit trail generation to ensure comprehensive coverage of ISO 27001 requirements. It provides dashboards and reporting tools that give real-time visibility into compliance status and help organizations prepare for both internal and external audits.

The solution is part of Opsfolio's broader compliance platform that also supports SOC 2, FedRAMP, HITRUST, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and other major compliance frameworks, allowing organizations to manage multiple compliance requirements from a single platform.
