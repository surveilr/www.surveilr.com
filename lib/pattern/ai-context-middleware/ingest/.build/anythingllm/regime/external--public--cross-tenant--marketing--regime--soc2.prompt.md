# Opsfolio

## What is Opsfolio and how does it work?

Opsfolio is a compliance automation platform that helps companies pass cybersecurity audits and obtain certifications like SOC2, HIPAA, ISO, CMMC, FedRAMP, and HITRUST. The company combines expert human guidance with AI automation and a "Compliance-as-Code" methodology to deliver guaranteed compliance outcomes rather than just providing software tools.

## Core Value Proposition

Opsfolio positions itself as "More than software. Better than consultants" by offering three integrated services:

1. **Expert-Guided Compliance**: Real compliance engineers provide fractional Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) services, compliance coaching, expert policy authoring, and audit preparation support.
2. **AI-Driven Policy & Evidence Tools**: Intelligent automation that generates compliance evidence from existing workflows, including automated evidence collection, policy generation, gap analysis, and real-time monitoring.
3. **Unified System of Record**: A centralized platform managing all compliance data, policies, controls, and audit trails with unified dashboards and audit readiness scoring.

## Compliance-as-Code Methodology

Opsfolio's distinctive approach treats compliance like software development. Individual Contributors (ICs) such as architects, engineers, QA specialists, and customer success teams can continue their regular work while Opsfolio automatically generates compliance evidence from artifacts they already produce - including code, test results, and customer feedback. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, eliminating duplicate compliance work.

Key features include:

- Code-first compliance evidence generation
- Version-controlled policies treated like code
- Automated evidence collection from development workflows
- Team-centric approach that doesn't disrupt core responsibilities

## Technology Foundation: surveilr

The platform is powered by surveilr, a downloadable single binary that runs securely on Windows, Linux, and macOS within customer infrastructure. This creates a "Compliance Evidence Warehouse" - a SQL-queryable private data warehouse that can operate on laptops with minimal IT support.

surveilr provides:

- Local-first, edge-based evidence collection
- SQL queryable data warehouse
- Private and secure data handling (data stays with the customer)
- Continuous surveillance and evidence collection
- Machine attestable, auditable evidence
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Competitive Differentiation

Compared to traditional compliance tools like Vanta and Drata, Opsfolio offers:

- Compliance-as-Code approach vs. DIY software tools
- Guaranteed compliance outcomes vs. software license with uncertain results
- 60% faster implementation via automated evidence collection
- Fractional CCO support and AI-powered insights vs. documentation and chat support
- Machine attestation where CI/CD pipelines become compliance evidence engines

## Target Market and Results

Opsfolio serves companies needing regulatory compliance certifications, particularly those with engineering-focused teams. The company claims:

- 500+ client companies
- 98% audit pass rate
- Ability to achieve SOC2 Type 2 certification in 2 months
- 60% faster compliance implementation compared to traditional methods

## Business Model

The platform combines human expertise (fractional compliance officers), AI automation for evidence collection and policy generation, and a technical infrastructure (surveilr) that maintains customer data privacy while enabling automated compliance reporting and machine attestation for auditors.

# Opsfolio SOC 2 Regime

## What is Opsfolio's SOC 2 certification process and how does it accelerate compliance?

**Opsfolio's SOC 2 Regime** is an accelerated compliance certification program that enables organizations to achieve SOC 2 certification in 2 months instead of the traditional 12+ month timeline.

**Phase 4 - Type 1 Audit (Days 16-18)**: Formal audit of control design conducted by certified CPA firms, validating that controls are appropriately designed to meet SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria.

**Phase 5 - Type 2 Preparation (Weeks 4-7)**: Six-month operating effectiveness period with continuous monitoring and evidence collection to demonstrate that controls are operating effectively over time.

## Key Differentiators and Benefits

**Accelerated Timeline**: Reduces traditional SOC 2 certification timeline from 12+ months to 2 months through automation, proven methodologies, and streamlined processes that eliminate common delays and bottlenecks.

**Processing Integrity**: System processing completeness, validity, accuracy, timeliness, and proper authorization, ensuring data integrity throughout all business processes.

**Confidentiality**: Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed, including data classification, encryption, and access restrictions.

**Privacy**: Personal information collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal practices aligned with privacy commitments and applicable privacy laws.

## Target Organizations

This SOC 2 certification process is designed for **SaaS companies**, **technology startups**, **fintech organizations**, **healthcare technology providers**, **data processing companies**, and any **B2B service providers** that handle customer data and need to demonstrate security and compliance to enterprise customers.
