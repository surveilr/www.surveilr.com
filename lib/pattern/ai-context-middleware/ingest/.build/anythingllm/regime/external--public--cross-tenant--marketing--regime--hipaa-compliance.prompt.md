# Opsfolio

## What is Opsfolio and how does it work?

Opsfolio is a compliance automation platform that helps companies pass cybersecurity audits and obtain certifications like SOC2, HIPAA, ISO, CMMC, FedRAMP, and HITRUST. The company combines expert human guidance with AI automation and a "Compliance-as-Code" methodology to deliver guaranteed compliance outcomes rather than just providing software tools.

## Core Value Proposition

Opsfolio positions itself as "More than software. Better than consultants" by offering three integrated services:

1. **Expert-Guided Compliance**: Real compliance engineers provide fractional Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) services, compliance coaching, expert policy authoring, and audit preparation support.
2. **AI-Driven Policy & Evidence Tools**: Intelligent automation that generates compliance evidence from existing workflows, including automated evidence collection, policy generation, gap analysis, and real-time monitoring.
3. **Unified System of Record**: A centralized platform managing all compliance data, policies, controls, and audit trails with unified dashboards and audit readiness scoring.

## Compliance-as-Code Methodology

Opsfolio's distinctive approach treats compliance like software development. Individual Contributors (ICs) such as architects, engineers, QA specialists, and customer success teams can continue their regular work while Opsfolio automatically generates compliance evidence from artifacts they already produce - including code, test results, and customer feedback. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, eliminating duplicate compliance work.

Key features include:

- Code-first compliance evidence generation
- Version-controlled policies treated like code
- Automated evidence collection from development workflows
- Team-centric approach that doesn't disrupt core responsibilities

## Technology Foundation: surveilr

The platform is powered by surveilr, a downloadable single binary that runs securely on Windows, Linux, and macOS within customer infrastructure. This creates a "Compliance Evidence Warehouse" - a SQL-queryable private data warehouse that can operate on laptops with minimal IT support.

surveilr provides:

- Local-first, edge-based evidence collection
- SQL queryable data warehouse
- Private and secure data handling (data stays with the customer)
- Continuous surveillance and evidence collection
- Machine attestable, auditable evidence
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Competitive Differentiation

Compared to traditional compliance tools like Vanta and Drata, Opsfolio offers:

- Compliance-as-Code approach vs. DIY software tools
- Guaranteed compliance outcomes vs. software license with uncertain results
- 60% faster implementation via automated evidence collection
- Fractional CCO support and AI-powered insights vs. documentation and chat support
- Machine attestation where CI/CD pipelines become compliance evidence engines

## Target Market and Results

Opsfolio serves companies needing regulatory compliance certifications, particularly those with engineering-focused teams. The company claims:

- 500+ client companies
- 98% audit pass rate
- Ability to achieve SOC2 Type 2 certification in 2 months
- 60% faster compliance implementation compared to traditional methods

## Business Model

The platform combines human expertise (fractional compliance officers), AI automation for evidence collection and policy generation, and a technical infrastructure (surveilr) that maintains customer data privacy while enabling automated compliance reporting and machine attestation for auditors.

# Opsfolio HIPAA Regime

## What is Opsfolio's HIPAA compliance process and how does it protect health information?

**Opsfolio's HIPAA Regime** is a comprehensive compliance program designed to help healthcare organizations, covered entities, and business associates achieve full HIPAA compliance in 90 days. This program focuses on **Comprehensive HIPAA Protection** by implementing all required administrative, physical, and technical safeguards with automated controls and expert guidance to protect Protected Health Information (PHI).

## Why HIPAA Compliance is Essential

**Legal Requirement**: HIPAA compliance is mandatory for any organization handling Protected Health Information (PHI), including healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates. Non-compliance can result in significant financial penalties and legal consequences.

**Patient Trust and Data Protection**: HIPAA compliance demonstrates commitment to protecting patient privacy and maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

**Business Continuity**: Proper HIPAA implementation prevents data breaches, reduces regulatory risk, and ensures continuity of healthcare operations without disruption from compliance violations.

**Market Access**: Many healthcare partnerships, contracts, and business relationships require demonstrated HIPAA compliance as a prerequisite for doing business.

## Complete HIPAA Safeguards Implementation

**Administrative Safeguards**: Implementation of policies and procedures including Security Officer assignment, workforce training programs, information access management protocols, security awareness and training programs, incident response procedures, and contingency planning for system emergencies.

**Physical Safeguards**: Comprehensive physical security measures including facility access controls with proper authentication mechanisms, workstation use restrictions and positioning requirements, device and media controls for portable storage devices, and secure disposal procedures for hardware and documentation containing PHI.

**Technical Safeguards**: Advanced technical protections including access controls with unique user identification and role-based permissions, comprehensive audit logging and monitoring systems, integrity protection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized alteration of ePHI, transmission security protocols, and encryption requirements for data at rest and in transit.

## Opsfolio's 90-Day HIPAA Implementation Process

**Phase 1 - Risk Assessment and Gap Analysis (Days 1-15)**: Comprehensive evaluation of current security posture against HIPAA requirements, identifying vulnerabilities in administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, and creating a prioritized remediation roadmap.

**Phase 2 - Policy and Procedure Development (Days 16-30)**: Implementation of HIPAA-compliant policies and procedures using proven templates, including privacy policies, security policies, breach notification procedures, and business associate agreements.

**Phase 3 - Technical Controls Implementation (Days 31-60)**: Deployment of automated technical safeguards including access controls, audit logging systems, encryption solutions, and monitoring tools that continuously protect ePHI.

**Phase 4 - Training and Documentation (Days 61-75)**: Comprehensive workforce training on HIPAA requirements, privacy practices, security procedures, and incident response protocols, along with complete documentation of all implemented safeguards.

**Phase 5 - Validation and Ongoing Monitoring (Days 76-90)**: Final validation of all implemented controls, establishment of ongoing monitoring and maintenance procedures, and creation of audit-ready documentation packages.

## Key Compliance Areas and Requirements

**Privacy Rule Compliance**: Implementation of minimum necessary standards, patient rights procedures, notice of privacy practices, authorization processes, and privacy impact assessments for system changes.

**Security Rule Compliance**: Comprehensive coverage of all required and addressable implementation specifications under administrative, physical, and technical safeguards categories.

**Breach Notification Rule**: Automated breach detection and notification systems that ensure compliance with 60-day individual notification, 60-day HHS notification, and annual media notification requirements.

**Business Associate Management**: Proper vetting, contracting, and ongoing monitoring of business associates handling PHI, including comprehensive Business Associate Agreements (BAAs).

## Target Organizations and Use Cases

This HIPAA compliance program is designed for **healthcare providers** (hospitals, clinics, physician practices), **health plans and insurers**, **healthcare clearinghouses**, **healthcare technology companies**, **telemedicine platforms**, **electronic health record vendors**, **medical device manufacturers**, and **business associates** that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of covered entities.

## Automated Compliance Management

**Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of access to PHI, automated detection of potential security incidents, and ongoing assessment of compliance posture across all systems handling health information.

**Evidence Collection**: Automated gathering and organization of compliance evidence including access logs, training records, risk assessments, and policy acknowledgments for regulatory audits and assessments.

**Risk Management**: Proactive identification and remediation of compliance gaps, automated vulnerability scanning, and continuous improvement of security controls based on emerging threats and regulatory changes.

## Business Outcomes and Compliance Benefits

Organizations implementing Opsfolio's HIPAA program typically achieve:
- Complete HIPAA compliance across all required safeguards within 90 days
- Reduced risk of costly data breaches and regulatory penalties
- Enhanced patient trust and competitive positioning in healthcare markets
- Streamlined audit processes with comprehensive documentation
- Foundation for additional healthcare compliance requirements (HITECH, state privacy laws)
- Improved operational efficiency through automated compliance monitoring

**Compliance Philosophy**: This program transforms HIPAA compliance from a complex regulatory burden into a manageable, systematic process that protects patients while enabling healthcare innovation and operational efficiency.
