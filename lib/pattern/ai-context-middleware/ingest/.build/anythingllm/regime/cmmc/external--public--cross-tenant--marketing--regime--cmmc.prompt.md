# Opsfolio

## What is Opsfolio and how does it work?

Opsfolio is a compliance automation platform that helps companies pass cybersecurity audits and obtain certifications like SOC2, HIPAA, ISO, CMMC, FedRAMP, and HITRUST. The company combines expert human guidance with AI automation and a "Compliance-as-Code" methodology to deliver guaranteed compliance outcomes rather than just providing software tools.

## Core Value Proposition

Opsfolio positions itself as "More than software. Better than consultants" by offering three integrated services:

1. **Expert-Guided Compliance**: Real compliance engineers provide fractional Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) services, compliance coaching, expert policy authoring, and audit preparation support.
2. **AI-Driven Policy & Evidence Tools**: Intelligent automation that generates compliance evidence from existing workflows, including automated evidence collection, policy generation, gap analysis, and real-time monitoring.
3. **Unified System of Record**: A centralized platform managing all compliance data, policies, controls, and audit trails with unified dashboards and audit readiness scoring.

## Compliance-as-Code Methodology

Opsfolio's distinctive approach treats compliance like software development. Individual Contributors (ICs) such as architects, engineers, QA specialists, and customer success teams can continue their regular work while Opsfolio automatically generates compliance evidence from artifacts they already produce - including code, test results, and customer feedback. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, eliminating duplicate compliance work.

Key features include:

- Code-first compliance evidence generation
- Version-controlled policies treated like code
- Automated evidence collection from development workflows
- Team-centric approach that doesn't disrupt core responsibilities

## Technology Foundation: surveilr

The platform is powered by surveilr, a downloadable single binary that runs securely on Windows, Linux, and macOS within customer infrastructure. This creates a "Compliance Evidence Warehouse" - a SQL-queryable private data warehouse that can operate on laptops with minimal IT support.

surveilr provides:

- Local-first, edge-based evidence collection
- SQL queryable data warehouse
- Private and secure data handling (data stays with the customer)
- Continuous surveillance and evidence collection
- Machine attestable, auditable evidence
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Competitive Differentiation

Compared to traditional compliance tools like Vanta and Drata, Opsfolio offers:

- Compliance-as-Code approach vs. DIY software tools
- Guaranteed compliance outcomes vs. software license with uncertain results
- 60% faster implementation via automated evidence collection
- Fractional CCO support and AI-powered insights vs. documentation and chat support
- Machine attestation where CI/CD pipelines become compliance evidence engines

## Target Market and Results

Opsfolio serves companies needing regulatory compliance certifications, particularly those with engineering-focused teams. The company claims:

- 500+ client companies
- 98% audit pass rate
- Ability to achieve SOC2 Type 2 certification in 2 months
- 60% faster compliance implementation compared to traditional methods

## Business Model

The platform combines human expertise (fractional compliance officers), AI automation for evidence collection and policy generation, and a technical infrastructure (surveilr) that maintains customer data privacy while enabling automated compliance reporting and machine attestation for auditors.

# Opsfolio CMMC Compliance Solution

## What is Opsfolio's CMMC offering and how does it help DoD contractors?

Opsfolio provides a comprehensive Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) compliance platform specifically designed to help Department of Defense (DoD) contractors and suppliers achieve the required cybersecurity certifications to bid on and maintain government contracts. CMMC 2.0 provides the U.S. Department of Defense with the means to protect private data from malicious attacks on its supply chain, and requirements will be incorporated into DoD contracts above the micro-purchase threshold where contractors handle Federal Contract Information (FCI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

**Understanding CMMC Levels and Requirements:**

CMMC 2.0 has three distinct certification levels that Opsfolio's platform addresses. Level 1 focuses on basic safeguarding of Federal Contract Information (FCI) through self-assessment with 17 security practices across 7 domains for foundational cybersecurity. Level 2 requires advanced protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) through third-party assessment with 110 practices aligned to NIST SP 800-171. CMMC Level 2 certification is necessary for contractors handling CUI, CDI, CTI, and ITAR data. Level 3 provides enhanced protection for the most sensitive CUI through expert-level assessment with additional practices for advanced persistent threats (APT).

**Opsfolio's CMMC Solution Features:**

Opsfolio streamlines the complex CMMC compliance process by automating evidence collection, policy management, and audit preparation across all three CMMC levels. The platform helps organizations achieve CMMC Level 2 certification in 4-6 months, significantly faster than traditional manual approaches. The system provides pre-built security control templates that map directly to NIST SP 800-171 requirements, automated gap analysis tools, and continuous monitoring capabilities to maintain compliance status.

The platform includes automated documentation generation, real-time compliance dashboards, and integrated audit management features. It automatically maps security controls to business processes and IT infrastructure, reducing the manual effort required to demonstrate compliance with CMMC requirements. Organizations can track their progress toward certification, identify gaps, and implement corrective actions through guided workflows.

**Business Impact and Contract Eligibility:**

The CMMC mandates standards, practices, and processes that all companies within the DoD supply chain must implement to bid on defense contracts, with requirements appearing in all contracts starting in fiscal year 2026. Opsfolio's CMMC solution directly enables organizations to maintain eligibility for DoD contracts by ensuring they meet the required cybersecurity standards.

The platform helps organizations protect their investment in DoD relationships by maintaining continuous compliance, not just achieving one-time certification. This is crucial because CMMC compliance is ongoing and requires regular assessment and maintenance. Organizations using Opsfolio can demonstrate their cybersecurity maturity to DoD customers and prime contractors, opening doors to new contract opportunities.

**Target Users and Implementation:**

Opsfolio's CMMC solution is designed for defense contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers of all sizes who need to handle Federal Contract Information or Controlled Unclassified Information. This includes companies in the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) as well as any organization in the broader DoD supply chain, from small businesses to large enterprise contractors.

The platform is particularly valuable for organizations that lack dedicated cybersecurity teams or CMMC expertise. It provides step-by-step guidance through the certification process, automated control implementation tracking, and preparation tools for third-party assessments required for Level 2 and Level 3 certifications.

**Integration and Technical Approach:**

Opsfolio integrates with existing IT infrastructure and security tools to provide centralized CMMC compliance management. The platform automatically collects evidence from connected systems, maintains audit trails, and provides real-time visibility into compliance status across all CMMC domains including Access Control, Audit and Accountability, Configuration Management, Identification and Authentication, Incident Response, Maintenance, and Media Protection.

The solution supports the entire CMMC lifecycle from initial gap assessment through certification maintenance. It provides automated reporting capabilities that align with CMMC assessment requirements and helps organizations prepare for Certified Third-Party Assessor Organization (C3PAO) evaluations.

**Regulatory Timeline and Compliance Requirements:**

CMMC requirements will appear in all DoD contracts starting in fiscal year 2026, with a five-year phased rollout. This makes timely compliance preparation critical for any organization seeking to maintain or establish DoD contract relationships. Opsfolio's accelerated 4-6 month timeline for Level 2 certification helps organizations meet these mandatory deadlines while ensuring comprehensive security implementation.

The platform stays current with evolving CMMC requirements and DoD guidance, automatically updating control mappings and assessment criteria as the program continues to develop. This ensures organizations maintain compliance with the latest CMMC standards without manual tracking of regulatory changes.

# CMMC Model Overview

## What is the CMMC Model and what are its specific security requirements?

**The CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) Model** is a structured cybersecurity framework consisting of 149 total security requirements across 14 domains, designed to protect Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB).

### Framework Structure
The CMMC Model incorporates security requirements from three foundational sources:
- **FAR 52.204-21**: Basic safeguarding requirements for FCI (15 requirements)
- **NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2**: Protecting CUI in nonfederal systems (110 requirements)  
- **NIST SP 800-172**: Enhanced security requirements for CUI (24 selected requirements with DoD parameters)

### Three-Level Architecture
**Level 1 (15 Requirements)**: Basic safeguarding of Federal Contract Information through FAR Clause 52.204-21 requirements. Assessment is binary (MET/NOT MET) with no scoring methodology.

**Level 2 (110 Requirements)**: Protection of Controlled Unclassified Information implementing all NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 requirements. Uses point-based scoring (1, 3, or 5 points per requirement) with minimum passing score of 88 out of 110 total points.

**Level 3 (24 Requirements)**: Enhanced protection against Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) using selected NIST SP 800-172 requirements with DoD-defined parameters. Requires perfect Level 2 score (110) as prerequisite, plus all Level 3 requirements (1 point each, total 24).

### Security Domains (14 Total)
1. **Access Control (AC)**: User authentication, authorization, and system access controls
2. **Awareness & Training (AT)**: Security education and role-based training programs
3. **Audit & Accountability (AU)**: System logging, monitoring, and audit record management
4. **Configuration Management (CM)**: Baseline configurations, change control, and system inventory
5. **Identification & Authentication (IA)**: User identity verification and multifactor authentication
6. **Incident Response (IR)**: Cybersecurity incident handling and response capabilities
7. **Maintenance (MA)**: System maintenance controls and equipment sanitization
8. **Media Protection (MP)**: Physical and digital media safeguarding and disposal
9. **Personnel Security (PS)**: Background screening and personnel risk management
10. **Physical Protection (PE)**: Physical access controls and facility security
11. **Risk Assessment (RA)**: Vulnerability scanning, threat hunting, and risk analysis
12. **Security Assessment (CA)**: Security control testing and system security planning
13. **System & Communications Protection (SC)**: Network security, encryption, and boundary protection
14. **System & Information Integrity (SI)**: Malware protection, system monitoring, and flaw remediation

### Key Implementation Details
**Requirement Identification Format**: Each requirement uses format DD.L#-REQ where DD is the domain abbreviation, L# is the level number, and REQ is the source requirement identifier.

**DoD-Approved Parameters**: Level 3 requirements include specific DoD-defined selections and parameters (indicated by underlining in official documentation) that modify base NIST SP 800-172 requirements.

**Scalability**: Organizations can implement CMMC for entire enterprise networks or specific enclaves, depending on where FCI/CUI is processed, stored, or transmitted.

**Compliance Alignment**: The model maintains alignment with existing DoD cybersecurity requirements under DFARS clauses 252.204-7012, 252.204-7019, and 252.204-7020, while introducing the new DFARS clause 252.204-7021.

### Assessment Requirements by Level
- **Level 1**: Covers basic safeguarding like authorized access control, media disposal, physical access limits, boundary protection, and malicious code protection
- **Level 2**: Comprehensive CUI protection including multifactor authentication, FIPS-validated cryptography, incident response capabilities, and network security controls
- **Level 3**: Advanced capabilities such as 24/7 Security Operations Center, threat hunting, penetration testing, advanced threat awareness training, and supply chain risk management

The CMMC Model serves as the technical foundation for the broader CMMC Program, providing the specific security requirements that defense contractors must implement to achieve certification levels required for DoD contract awards.

# CMMC Level 1 Scoping Guide

## How do you determine the scope for a CMMC Level 1 self-assessment?

**CMMC Level 1 Scoping** defines which assets within an organization's environment must be assessed against the 15 basic safeguarding requirements for Federal Contract Information (FCI) protection. The scoping process is streamlined for Level 1, requiring no formal documentation but establishing clear boundaries for self-assessment.

### Core Scoping Principle

The fundamental scoping rule for Level 1 assessments is: **All assets that process, store, or transmit Federal Contract Information (FCI) are in scope** unless they qualify as Specialized Assets.

### FCI Asset Activities Definition

**Process**: FCI is actively used by an asset through accessing, entering, editing, generating, manipulating, or printing activities.

**Store**: FCI is inactive or at rest on an asset, including electronic media, system component memory, or physical formats like paper documents.

**Transmit**: FCI is being transferred between assets using physical or digital transport methods (data in transit).

### In-Scope vs Out-of-Scope Assets

**In-Scope Assets**: All systems, devices, and components that process, store, or transmit FCI must be assessed against all 15 Level 1 security requirements per 32 CFR § 170.19(b).

**Out-of-Scope Assets**: Systems and devices that do not handle FCI in any capacity are excluded from the CMMC assessment scope per 32 CFR § 170.19(b)(2).

### Specialized Assets (Automatically Excluded)

Level 1 assessments exclude specific asset categories that cannot be fully secured, as defined in 32 CFR § 170.19(b)(2)(ii):

**Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)**: Government-owned property provided to contractors for contract performance, including spares and maintenance items.

**Internet of Things (IoT/IIoT)**: Interconnected devices with sensing, actuation, and programmability features, including smart building systems like lighting, HVAC, and fire detection.

**Operational Technology (OT)**: Programmable systems controlling physical environments, including industrial control systems, building management systems, SCADA systems, and physical access controls.

**Restricted Information Systems**: Systems configured entirely by government security requirements and used to support contracts, including fielded systems and obsolete systems.

**Test Equipment**: Hardware and IT components specifically used for testing products, system components, and contract deliverables.

### Four-Category Assessment Framework

Organizations must consider these categories when determining scope per 32 CFR § 170.19(b)(3):

**People**: Employees, contractors, vendors, and external service provider personnel who handle FCI.

**Technology**: Servers, client computers, mobile devices, network appliances (firewalls, switches, access points, routers), VoIP devices, applications, virtual machines, and database systems.

**Facilities**: Physical locations including offices, satellite offices, server rooms, datacenters, manufacturing plants, and secured rooms where FCI is processed or stored.

**External Service Providers (ESP)**: Third-party entities providing comprehensive IT or cybersecurity services that handle FCI on the organization's behalf.

### Level 1 Scoping Requirements

**No Documentation Required**: Unlike higher levels, Level 1 self-assessments do not require formal documentation of In-Scope, Out-of-Scope, or Specialized Assets.

**Self-Assessment Focus**: The streamlined approach allows Organizations Seeking Assessment (OSAs) to conduct efficient self-evaluations while ensuring comprehensive FCI protection.

**Assessment Validity**: Scoping remains valid until significant architectural or boundary changes occur (network expansions, mergers, acquisitions). Operational changes within existing boundaries are covered by annual compliance affirmations.

### Practical Scoping Examples

**People Identification** supports requirements like IA.L1-b.1.v (user identification) by determining who needs system access.

**Technology Inventory** informs requirements such as AC.L1-b.1.iii (external system connections) and SC.L1-b.1.x (boundary protection) by mapping network assets and communication paths.

The Level 1 scoping approach prioritizes practical implementation while maintaining focus on FCI protection across the organization's operational environment.

# CMMC Level 1 Assessment Guide

## How do you conduct a CMMC Level 1 self-assessment and what are the specific requirements?

**CMMC Level 1 Self-Assessment** is a self-conducted evaluation process where Organizations Seeking Assessment (OSAs) determine their compliance with 15 basic safeguarding requirements for Federal Contract Information (FCI) protection, as specified in FAR Clause 52.204-21 and codified in 32 CFR § 170.15.

### Assessment Framework and Methodology
Level 1 self-assessments use **NIST SP 800-171A assessment objectives** modified for FCI rather than CUI, employing three assessment methods:

**Examine Method**: Review, inspect, observe, study, or analyze assessment objects including specifications (policies, procedures, security plans), mechanisms (hardware, software, firmware safeguards), activities (protection-related actions), and individuals.

**Interview Method**: Hold discussions with personnel to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence from staff at different organizational levels.

**Test Method**: Exercise assessment objects under specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior, providing hands-on demonstration of requirement implementation.

### Assessment Findings and Scoring
Level 1 assessments result in three possible findings per 32 CFR § 170.24:

**MET**: All applicable objectives satisfied based on final-form evidence (no drafts or working papers accepted). Includes Enduring Exceptions documented in system security plans and temporary deficiencies with operational plans of action.

**NOT MET**: One or more objectives not satisfied. A single NOT MET assessment objective causes failure of the entire security requirement.

**NOT APPLICABLE (N/A)**: Security requirement doesn't apply at assessment time. Equivalent to MET for scoring purposes.

**Compliance Requirement**: All 15 Level 1 requirements must achieve MET or N/A status for successful assessment completion.

### 15 Level 1 Security Requirements by Domain

**Access Control (AC) - 4 Requirements**:
- AC.L1-b.1.i: Limit system access to authorized users, processes, and devices
- AC.L1-b.1.ii: Limit access to authorized transactions and functions 
- AC.L1-b.1.iii: Verify and control external system connections
- AC.L1-b.1.iv: Control information on publicly accessible systems

**Identification and Authentication (IA) - 2 Requirements**:
- IA.L1-b.1.v: Identify system users, processes, and devices
- IA.L1-b.1.vi: Authenticate user, process, and device identities

**Media Protection (MP) - 1 Requirement**:
- MP.L1-b.1.vii: Sanitize or destroy media containing FCI before disposal/reuse

**Physical Protection (PE) - 2 Requirements**:
- PE.L1-b.1.viii: Limit physical access to authorized individuals
- PE.L1-b.1.ix: Escort visitors, maintain access logs, control physical access devices

**System and Communications Protection (SC) - 2 Requirements**:
- SC.L1-b.1.x: Monitor, control, and protect communications at system boundaries
- SC.L1-b.1.xi: Implement separated subnetworks for publicly accessible components

**System and Information Integrity (SI) - 4 Requirements**:
- SI.L1-b.1.xii: Identify, report, and correct system flaws timely
- SI.L1-b.1.xiii: Provide malicious code protection at appropriate locations
- SI.L1-b.1.xiv: Update malicious code protection when new releases available
- SI.L1-b.1.xv: Perform periodic and real-time malicious code scanning

### Key Assessment Considerations
**Evidence Requirements**: All evidence must be in final form - drafts, working papers, and unofficial policies are unacceptable. Organizations must demonstrate actual implementation, not just documentation.

**External Service Provider (ESP) Compliance**: Requirements may be satisfied through enterprise components or ESPs, including cloud providers, managed service providers, or cybersecurity-as-a-service providers.

**Assessment Flexibility**: Organizations determine appropriate assessment methods and objects to accomplish objectives in the most cost-effective manner with sufficient confidence.

**Scope Definition**: Assessment scope must be defined per 32 CFR § 170.19, covering all assets that process, store, or transmit FCI, excluding Specialized Assets (IoT, IIoT, OT, GFE, Restricted Information Systems, Test Equipment).

### Assessment Deliverables
**SPRS Submission**: Primary result is submission of Level 1 compliance results into the Supplier Performance Risk System.

**Self-Assessment Report**: Contains findings associated with the self-assessment, documenting MET/NOT MET/N/A determinations for each requirement.

**Third-Party Assistance**: Organizations may engage third parties to assist with self-assessment while maintaining self-assessment status (not certification).

### Implementation Examples and Practical Application
Each requirement includes specific implementation examples, such as maintaining authorized user lists (AC.L1-b.1.i), establishing visitor escort procedures (PE.L1-b.1.ix), implementing firewall boundary protection (SC.L1-b.1.x), and configuring automated malware updates (SI.L1-b.1.xiv).

The Level 1 self-assessment process emphasizes practical cybersecurity implementation over extensive documentation, making it accessible to organizations of all sizes while ensuring fundamental FCI protection capabilities are established and maintained.

# CMMC Level 2 Scoping Guide

## How do you determine the scope for CMMC Level 2 self-assessments and certification assessments?

**CMMC Level 2 Scoping** establishes assessment boundaries for the 110 security requirements protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) per 32 CFR § 170.19(c). Unlike Level 1's simple FCI-based scoping, Level 2 uses a sophisticated five-category asset classification system that determines assessment requirements and depth.

### Five-Category Asset Classification Framework

**CUI Assets**: Systems that process, store, or transmit CUI through accessing, entering, editing, generating, manipulating, printing (process); storing on electronic media, system memory, or physical formats (store); or transferring between assets via physical or digital methods (transmit). **Assessment**: Full evaluation against all 110 Level 2 security requirements.

**Security Protection Assets**: Systems providing security functions or capabilities within the CMMC Assessment Scope, including cloud-based security solutions, SIEM systems, VPN services, SOCs, managed service provider personnel, and enterprise network administrators. **Assessment**: Evaluated against Level 2 requirements relevant to capabilities provided.

**Contractor Risk Managed Assets (CRMAs)**: Systems capable of, but not intended to, handle CUI due to implemented security policies, procedures, and practices. Not required to be physically or logically separated from CUI assets. **Assessment**: SSP documentation review; if insufficiently documented or findings raise questions, limited compliance checks conducted (cannot materially increase assessment duration or cost).

**Specialized Assets**: Systems that can process, store, or transmit CUI but cannot be fully secured, including IoT devices, IIoT systems, Operational Technology (OT), SCADA systems, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), Restricted Information Systems, and Test Equipment. **Assessment**: SSP documentation review only; no technical security requirement assessment.

**Out-of-Scope Assets**: Systems that cannot process, store, or transmit CUI and provide no security protections for CUI assets. Must be physically or logically separated from CUI assets. **Assessment**: None (excluded from scope entirely).

### Required Documentation and Preparation
**Asset Inventory**: All in-scope assets (CUI, Security Protection, CRMA, Specialized) must be documented in comprehensive inventory.

**System Security Plan (SSP)**: Required documentation of asset treatment, security controls implementation, risk-based policies for CRMAs and Specialized Assets, and enterprise security architecture.

**Network Diagram**: Visual representation of CMMC Assessment Scope showing all in-scope assets and security boundaries to facilitate pre-assessment scoping discussions.

### Physical and Logical Separation Concepts
**Logical Separation**: Prevents data transfer between physically connected assets through non-physical means (firewalls, routers, VPNs, VLANs). Enables Out-of-Scope Asset classification.

**Physical Separation**: No wired or wireless connections between assets; data transfer only through manual methods (USB drives). Provides strongest separation assurance.

**Separation Benefits**: Effective separation per NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 guidance can limit CMMC Assessment Scope by isolating CUI-handling components in separate security domains.

### External Service Provider (ESP) Considerations
**ESP Scope Criteria**: ESPs enter assessment scope when CUI or Security Protection Data resides on their assets per 32 CFR § 170.19(c)(2).

**Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Requirements**: 
- ESPs storing/processing/transmitting CUI must meet FedRAMP requirements per DFARS 252.204-7012
- ESPs not handling CUI have no FedRAMP requirement but services remain in OSA assessment scope

**Documentation Requirements**: ESP relationships, services, and responsibilities must be documented in SSP and Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) detailing security requirement allocation between OSA and ESP.

**Assessment Approach**: ESP portions providing services to OSA are assessed as part of OSA's CMMC evaluation; ESPs may voluntarily request independent C3PAO assessment.

### Assessment Type Differences
**Self-Assessment (OSA)**: Organization evaluates own systems per 32 CFR § 170.16 using identical security requirements as certification assessment.

**Certification Assessment (OSC)**: Independent evaluation by C3PAO per 32 CFR § 170.17 resulting in CMMC certification and official status recognition.

**Level 3 Preparation**: Organizations seeking Level 3 must achieve Final Level 2 (C3PAO) status and close all POA&Ms before initiating Level 3 assessment. CRMAs in Level 2 scope become CUI Assets in Level 3 scope.

### Scope Boundaries and Changes
**Assessment Validity**: Scope remains valid until significant architectural or boundary changes occur (network expansions, mergers, acquisitions).

**Operational Changes**: Adding/subtracting resources within existing boundaries following established SSP covered by annual compliance affirmations rather than new assessments.

**Enterprise vs. Enclave Implementation**: Security requirements may be satisfied enterprise-wide or within specific enclaves. OSAs determine inheritance relationships while ensuring all requirements achieve MET status.

### Use Case Scenarios
**FCI/CUI Co-location**: Level 2 assessment satisfies Level 1 requirements for same scope; Level 2 security implementations address Level 1 assessment objectives.

**FCI/CUI Separation**: Independent assessments required when FCI and CUI exist in separate environments with distinct security implementations.

**Security Protection Data (SPD)**: Logs, configuration data, and security-relevant information created by or used by Security Protection Assets; includes hot storage (immediate access) and cold storage (archived) considerations.

The Level 2 scoping framework balances comprehensive CUI protection with practical implementation flexibility, enabling organizations to align CMMC boundaries with business architecture while maintaining regulatory compliance.

## Assessment Methodology and Procedures

**NIST SP 800-171A Framework Implementation:**
Based on NIST Special Publication 800-171A assessment procedures, each requirement evaluation includes:

- **Assessment Objectives:** Specific determination statements that must be satisfied
- **Assessment Methods:** Three complementary approaches for evidence gathering
- **Assessment Objects:** Four categories of items to be evaluated

**Three-Method Assessment Approach:**

1. **Interview Method:** Process of holding discussions with individuals or groups to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence about security practices and implementation
2. **Examine Method:** Process of reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or analyzing assessment objects including specifications, mechanisms, and activities
3. **Test Method:** Process of exercising assessment objects under specified conditions to compare actual versus expected behavior and demonstrate functionality

**Four Assessment Object Categories:**

- **Specifications:** Document-based artifacts (policies, procedures, security plans, requirements, architectural designs)
- **Mechanisms:** Specific hardware, software, or firmware safeguards employed within systems
- **Activities:** Protection-related actions involving people (backups, contingency plans, monitoring)
- **Individuals:** People applying the specifications, mechanisms, or activities

**Assessment Findings Framework:**

- **MET:** All applicable assessment objectives satisfied based on evidence (including properly documented Enduring Exceptions and Temporary Deficiencies with operational plans)
- **NOT MET:** One or more objectives not satisfied, requiring remediation or POA&M documentation
- **NOT APPLICABLE (N/A):** Security requirement doesn't apply at time of assessment (equivalent to MET for scoring)

**Critical Assessment Rules:**

- All evidence must be in final form (no drafts or working papers accepted)
- One NOT MET objective results in failure of entire security requirement
- External Service Providers (ESPs) can satisfy requirements if adequate evidence provided
- DoD CIO adjudications for alternative measures must be documented in System Security Plan

## Target Audience and Use Cases

**Primary Users:**

- Defense contractors and subcontractors handling CUI
- Cybersecurity professionals conducting assessments
- C3PAO assessors performing certification evaluations
- Organizations preparing for DoD contract compliance

**Business Impact:**

- Required for DoD contract eligibility involving CUI
- Demonstrates cybersecurity maturity to government customers
- Protects sensitive government information in contractor systems
- Enables participation in defense supply chain

## Compliance Timeline and Requirements

Organizations must achieve either:

- **Conditional Level 2 (C3PAO):** Temporary certification with planned remediation
- **Final Level 2 (C3PAO):** Full certification meeting all requirements

The assessment scope must include all systems that process, store, or transmit CUI within the organization's information system boundary.

## Key Differentiators from Other Security Frameworks

Unlike general cybersecurity frameworks, CMMC Level 2 specifically:

- Focuses on protecting government CUI data
- Requires third-party validation for many contracts
- Integrates supply chain security considerations
- Mandates specific technical controls based on NIST 800-171
- Links cybersecurity compliance directly to contract eligibility

This guide serves as the authoritative resource for understanding, implementing, and assessing cybersecurity controls required for organizations seeking to handle Controlled Unclassified Information in support of Department of Defense missions.

# CMMC Level 3 Scoping Guide

## What is the CMMC Level 3 Scoping Guide?

The CMMC Level 3 Scoping Guide is an official Department of Defense document (Version 2.13, September 2024) that provides comprehensive guidance for Organizations Seeking Certification (OSCs) on defining assessment boundaries and asset categorization for Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification Level 3 assessments. This guide is specifically designed for defense contractors who handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and require the highest level of CMMC certification.

## Purpose and Requirements

**Primary Purpose**: Define which assets within an organization's environment will be assessed during a Level 3 CMMC certification assessment conducted by the Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center (DIBCAC).

**Prerequisites**: Organizations must have a Final Level 2 (C3PAO) CMMC Status for the same assessment scope, with all Level 2 Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) items closed before initiating Level 3 assessment.

## Four Critical Asset Categories

### 1. CUI Assets (In-Scope)

- **Definition**: Assets that process, store, or transmit Controlled Unclassified Information
- **Includes**: Previously designated Contractor Risk Managed Assets (CRMAs) from Level 2
- **Assessment**: Limited Level 2 check plus full Level 3 security requirements assessment
- **Requirements**: Document in asset inventory, System Security Plan (SSP), and network diagram

### 2. Security Protection Assets (In-Scope)

- **Definition**: Assets providing security functions regardless of CUI processing capability
- **Examples**: SIEM solutions, VPN services, cloud security tools, security consultants, SOCs
- **Assessment**: Level 3 requirements relevant to security capabilities provided
- **Special Data**: Security Protection Data (logs, configurations, vulnerability data) requires protection

### 3. Specialized Assets (In-Scope)

- **Types**: IoT/IIoT devices, Operational Technology (OT), Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), Restricted Information Systems, Test Equipment
- **Limitations**: May be unable to fully implement security controls
- **Accommodation**: Intermediary devices (proxies, boundary devices) permitted to meet requirements
- **Assessment**: All Level 3 requirements unless physically/logically isolated

### 4. Out-of-Scope Assets (Excluded)

- **Definition**: Cannot process, store, or transmit CUI and provide no security protections
- **Requirements**: Must justify inability to handle CUI; no assessment requirements
- **Note**: VDI clients configured for keyboard/video/mouse only are considered out-of-scope

## External Service Provider (ESP) Considerations

**Critical Distinction**: ESPs are categorized as either Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) or non-CSPs:

- **CSPs with CUI**: Must meet FedRAMP requirements (DFARS 252.204-7012)
- **Non-CSPs with CUI**: Require CMMC assessment as part of OSC's scope
- **ESPs without CUI**: Services included in OSC assessment scope but ESP not separately assessed

**Documentation Requirements**: Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) and service descriptions must clearly delineate security responsibilities between OSC and ESP.

## Key Compliance Requirements

1. **Asset Inventory**: All in-scope assets must be documented
2. **System Security Plan (SSP)**: Asset treatment and ESP relationships documented
3. **Network Diagram**: Visual representation of CMMC Assessment Scope
4. **Boundary Definition**: Clear logical and physical separation of in-scope vs. out-of-scope assets

## Assessment Validity and Scope Changes

- **Scope Stability**: Assessments valid for defined scope until significant architectural changes
- **Scope Changes Requiring New Assessment**: Network expansions, mergers, acquisitions
- **Operational Changes**: Adding/removing resources within existing boundary covered by annual compliance affirmations

## Regulatory Foundation

This guidance implements requirements from 32 CFR § 170.19 and supports DoD's CMMC Program for protecting CUI in the Defense Industrial Base. The document carries Distribution Statement A (approved for public release, unlimited distribution) and serves as official DoD policy guidance for Level 3 CMMC scoping decisions.

# CMMC Level 3 Assessment Guide

## What is the CMMC Level 3 Assessment Guide?

The CMMC Level 3 Assessment Guide is an official Department of Defense document (Version 2.13, September 2024) that provides comprehensive guidance for conducting Level 3 certification assessments under the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Program. This guide is designed for assessors, Organizations Seeking Certification (OSCs), and cybersecurity professionals involved in the most stringent level of CMMC certification, which addresses protection against Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).

## Assessment Authority and Prerequisites

**Exclusive Assessment Authority**: Level 3 certification assessments are conducted exclusively by the DCMA Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center (DIBCAC), not by third-party assessment organizations (C3PAOs).

**Mandatory Prerequisite**: Organizations must first achieve a "Final Level 2 (C3PAO)" CMMC Status for all applicable information systems within the same CMMC Assessment Scope before proceeding to Level 3 assessment.

**Self-Assessment Limitation**: While organizations may use this guide for internal self-assessments (such as preparation for annual affirmations), only DIBCAC assessment results are accepted for official Level 3 certification.

## Level 3 Security Requirements Framework

**Foundation Standards**: Level 3 consists of 24 selected security requirements derived from NIST Special Publication 800-172 (Enhanced Security Requirements for Protecting CUI), building upon the NIST SP 800-171 requirements established at Level 2.

**Enhanced Protection Focus**: Level 3 provides additional protections against Advanced Persistent Threats and increased assurance for protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in multi-tier supply chain environments.

## Assessment Methodology and Criteria

**NIST SP 800-172A Foundation**: Assessment procedures leverage NIST SP 800-172A methodology, incorporating assessment objectives, methods, and objects for each requirement.

**Three Assessment Methods**:

1. **Examine**: Reviewing specifications, mechanisms, and activities through documentation and demonstrations
2. **Interview**: Conducting discussions with organizational personnel at various levels
3. **Test**: Exercising assessment objects under specified conditions to verify actual versus expected behavior

**Assessment Findings**: Each requirement receives one of three findings:

- **MET**: All applicable assessment objectives satisfied with adequate evidence
- **NOT MET**: One or more objectives not satisfied (results in overall requirement failure)
- **NOT APPLICABLE**: Requirement does not apply to the current assessment scope

## Specialized Requirements and Considerations

**Organization-Defined Parameters (ODPs)**: Selected requirements contain DoD-specified parameters that customize security requirements, with additional organizational flexibility where needed.

**External Service Provider Integration**: Comprehensive guidance for incorporating ESP capabilities into assessments, including cloud service providers and managed security service providers.

**Specialized Asset Handling**: Specific requirements for Internet of Things (IoT), Industrial IoT (IIoT), Operational Technology (OT), Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), and test equipment integration.

**Enduring Exceptions**: Recognition that some specialized assets may have documented limitations preventing full compliance, requiring alternative security measures and documentation in the System Security Plan.

## Critical Assessment Documentation

**System Security Plan (SSP)**: Central document linking security requirements to implemented controls and solutions, with specific emphasis on risk-based security solution selection and rationale.

**Evidence Requirements**: All evidence must be in final form (not drafts or working papers) with clear traceability to assessment objectives.

**Threat Intelligence Integration**: Requirements mandate use of threat intelligence from open, commercial, and DoD-provided sources to inform security architectures, monitoring, and response activities.

## Advanced Security Capabilities

**24/7 Security Operations**: Mandatory Security Operations Center with continuous monitoring capability, including remote/on-call staff arrangements.

**Threat Hunting Program**: Ongoing aperiodic cyber threat hunting activities to search for indicators of compromise and detect threats that evade existing controls.

**Advanced Automation**: Employment of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced analytics to support risk prediction and identification.

**Supply Chain Risk Management**: Comprehensive assessment, response, and monitoring of supply chain risks with documented management plans updated annually or upon threat intelligence receipt.

## Regulatory and Compliance Context

This guide implements requirements from 32 CFR § 170.18 and supports the DoD CMMC Program's mission to protect Controlled Unclassified Information in the Defense Industrial Base. The assessment process ensures organizations demonstrate capabilities commensurate with Advanced Persistent Threat risk levels while maintaining operational effectiveness in supporting DoD missions and contracts.

# CMMC Artifact Hashing Guide

## What is the CMMC Artifact Hashing Tool?

The CMMC Artifact Hashing Tool is an official Department of Defense PowerShell script (Version 2.13, September 2024) designed to generate cryptographic hashes of assessment artifacts collected during CMMC certification assessments. This tool ensures the integrity and authenticity of evidence used in CMMC assessments while protecting proprietary organizational information by allowing artifacts to remain with the Organization Seeking Assessment (OSA).

## Purpose and Assessment Integration

**Assessment Artifact Protection**: During CMMC assessments, assessment teams collect objective evidence through three methods: examination of artifacts, affirmations through interviews, and observations of actions. Because these artifacts often contain proprietary information, they cannot be retained off-site by assessors.

**Integrity Verification Requirement**: Per 32 CFR § 170.17 and 32 CFR § 170.18, a cryptographic reference (hash) must be generated for each artifact used in assessments. This allows future integrity verification without compromising confidentiality.

**Mandatory Usage Scope**: Hashing is required only for formal assessments conducted by CMMC Third-Party Assessment Organizations (C3PAOs) and DCMA Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center (DIBCAC). Self-assessments do not require artifact hashing.

## Technical Specifications and Requirements

**Cryptographic Algorithm**: Uses SHA-256 hashing algorithm to generate unique fingerprints for each assessment artifact.

**System Compatibility**: 
- Requires Microsoft PowerShell (available for Windows, Linux, and macOS)
- Tested on Windows 11 (23H2), Windows 10 (1904), Linux (Ubuntu 20.04), and macOS (10.15.7)
- May require administrator permissions to execute PowerShell scripts

**Dual-Hash Architecture**: 
1. **Primary Hash**: Generates SHA-256 hash for each individual artifact file
2. **Integrity Hash**: Creates a hash of the complete artifact list to protect the integrity of the entire evidence collection

## Tool Operation Process

**File Organization Requirements**: Assessment artifacts must be consolidated into a central location, either as a single root directory or organized in subdirectories. The tool can accommodate both flat and hierarchical file structures.

**Generated Output Files**:
- **CMMCAssessmentArtifacts.log**: Contains algorithm type, hash value, and file path for each artifact
- **CMMCAssessmentLogHash.log**: Contains single hash value of the artifacts log file

**Command Execution**:
```
Windows: powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass .\ArtifactHash.ps1 -ArtifactRootDirectory .\ -ArtifactOutputDirectory .\
Linux/macOS: pwsh -ExecutionPolicy ByPass ./ArtifactHash.ps1 -ArtifactRootDirectory ./ -ArtifactOutputDirectory ./
```

## Integration with CMMC Assessment Workflow

**Assessment Planning Phase**: OSA and assessment team jointly determine secure artifact storage location accessible only to those with need-to-know.

**Evidence Collection Phase**: Artifacts gathered during interviews, examinations, and observations are consolidated into the designated central location.

**Hash Generation Phase**: After all assessment activities conclude, OSA runs the hashing tool on collected artifacts.

**Record Retention**: Both OSA and assessor retain copies of the hash files. OSA must maintain original artifacts for six (6) years from assessment date.

**eMASS Integration**: Hash outputs are entered into specific data fields in the CMMC instantiation of eMASS (Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service):
- **Hashed Data List field**: Filename from CMMCAssessmentArtifacts.log
- **Hash Value field**: Hash string from CMMCAssessmentLogHash.log

## Security and Confidentiality Considerations

**Hashing vs. Encryption Distinction**: The tool provides integrity verification but does not encrypt or provide confidentiality protection for artifacts. Organizations must implement separate encryption mechanisms for confidentiality protection.

**Data Protection Requirements**: Organizations must consider appropriate data protection requirements when selecting artifact archival locations, as the hashing process does not secure the actual content.

**Access Control**: Artifact storage locations should be secured and accessible only to personnel with legitimate need-to-know, given the potentially sensitive or proprietary nature of assessment evidence.

## Operational Parameters and Flexibility

**Three Configurable Parameters**:
1. **ExecutionPolicy**: Recommended "ByPass" value to override PowerShell execution restrictions
2. **ArtifactRootDirectory**: Specifies location of assessment artifacts (supports Windows paths, UNC paths, or current directory)
3. **ArtifactOutputDirectory**: Defines where hash log files will be generated

**File Naming Standards**: Recommends standardized naming patterns or grouping by CMMC requirement to facilitate future audits or retrospective reviews.

**Recursive Processing**: Tool automatically processes all files within specified directory structure, including subdirectories, ensuring comprehensive coverage of assessment evidence.

## Compliance and Regulatory Context

This hashing process supports the CMMC Program's evidence preservation requirements while balancing the need to protect organizational intellectual property. The tool ensures compliance with federal regulations governing CMMC assessments while enabling organizations to maintain control over their sensitive information throughout the six-year retention period.

The hashing methodology provides a cryptographically sound approach to evidence integrity verification that supports potential future audits or reviews without compromising the confidentiality of proprietary organizational data.

# FedRAMP Authorization and Equivalency for Defense Industrial Base

## What is FedRAMP Equivalency and how does it differ from FedRAMP Authorization?

FedRAMP Equivalency is an alternative compliance pathway established under DFARS 252.204-7012 that allows Defense Industrial Base (DIB) contractors to use Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs) that meet security requirements equivalent to the FedRAMP Moderate baseline for processing, storing, or transmitting covered defense information (CDI). Critically, FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency does not confer actual FedRAMP Moderate Authorization - it provides flexibility for contractors to use cloud services that demonstrate equivalent security controls without requiring formal federal authorization.

**Key Distinction**: While FedRAMP Authorization involves official government Authority to Operate (ATO) with accepted risk by an Authorizing Official, FedRAMP Equivalency requires 100% compliance with FedRAMP Moderate baseline controls with complete risk avoidance, as there is no government sponsor to accept residual risk.

## DFARS 252.204-7012 Cloud Service Requirements

The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement mandates that contractors using external cloud service providers for covered defense information must ensure those providers meet security requirements equivalent to FedRAMP Moderate baseline. This requirement drives the need for the equivalency pathway, providing contractors with cloud options beyond traditionally FedRAMP-authorized services while maintaining required security standards.

## Current FedRAMP Program Transition Status

**Legislative Changes**: The 2022 FedRAMP Authorization Act replaced the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) with a FedRAMP Board, fundamentally altering program operations and oversight responsibilities.

**Transition Timeline**:
- **Phase I (Completed)**: October-December 2024 transition of JAB-authorized systems to designated lead agencies (DoD, DHS, GSA, or FedRAMP)
- **Phase II (In Progress)**: Implementation of multi-agency continuous monitoring with FedRAMP PMO support

**Impact**: Former P-ATO letters have terminated, and previously JAB-authorized systems now operate under new agency-specific oversight models.

## Roles and Responsibilities Framework

**DIB Contractors**:
- Validate CSO meets FedRAMP Moderate equivalent standards
- Review Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) Body of Evidence (BoE)
- Provide Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) to assessors
- Approve CSO usage and confirm Incident Response Plan compliance
- Report security incidents per contract requirements

**Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs)**:
- Conduct comprehensive CSO security assessments
- Deliver complete Body of Evidence package including:
  - System Security Plan (SSP) with security policies, contingency plans, incident response procedures
  - Security Assessment Plan (SAP) with test procedures and annual penetration testing
  - Security Assessment Report (SAR) with risk exposure analysis and monthly scanning results
  - Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) with continuous monitoring strategy

**DIBCAC (Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center)**:
- Reviews CSP Body of Evidence for FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency
- Validates DFARS 252.204-7012 and 252.204-7020 compliance

- Implements contractor-required controls within CMMC framework

## Compliance Requirements and Risk Management

**100% Compliance Mandate**: CSOs must achieve complete compliance with the latest FedRAMP Moderate Baseline following assessment by a FedRAMP-recognized 3PAO. Unlike traditional FedRAMP authorizations, no residual risk acceptance is permitted.

**POA&M Management**:
- Continuing operational POA&Ms are acceptable during CSO operation
- All high and critical risk findings must be remediated before receiving equivalency determination
- Remediation timeframes: 30/90/180 days based on criticality level
- Must include remediation plans and scheduled completion dates

## Cloud Service Provider Recommendations

**Best Practices for CSPs**:
1. **Early 3PAO Engagement**: Partner with FedRAMP-recognized assessment organizations during planning phases
2. **Readiness Assessment**: Conduct preliminary evaluations before formal testing to identify gaps
3. **Strong Internal Governance**: Maintain robust security documentation and incident reporting procedures
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement monthly infrastructure and web scanning with annual validation
5. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct annual penetration testing with validated methodologies

# CMMC Level Determination Criteria and Requirements

## How is the appropriate CMMC level determined for defense contractors?

CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification) level determination follows a systematic decision process based on the type of information handled by defense contractors. The primary determining factor is whether the contractor processes, stores, or transmits Federal Contract Information (FCI) only, or also handles Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). The level determination directly impacts assessment requirements, with higher levels requiring more stringent certification processes.

**Decision Framework**: The determination process uses a flowchart-based approach that evaluates information types and their classification within government registries to assign the appropriate CMMC level and assessment type.

## CMMC Level 1 Requirements

**Applicable Contractors**: Organizations that process, store, or transmit only Federal Contract Information (FCI) must complete CMMC Level 1 requirements.

**Assessment Type**: Self-assessment conducted annually by the contractor
**Security Requirements**: 15 security requirements specified in FAR clause 52.204-21
**Information Type**: FCI includes information provided by or generated for the government under a contract that is not intended for public release

## CMMC Level 2 Requirements and Determination Criteria

**Primary Trigger**: Contractors or subcontractors who process, store, or transmit Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) on their information systems must meet CMMC Level 2 requirements at minimum.

**Two Assessment Pathways for Level 2**:

### Level 2 Self-Assessment

- **Required For**: CUI that appears in the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) CUI Registry but is NOT in the Defense Organizational Index Grouping (OIG)
- **Assessment Method**: Self-assessment conducted by the contractor
- **Frequency**: As determined by contract requirements

### Level 2 Certification

- **Required For**: CUI that appears in both the NARA CUI Registry AND the Defense Organizational Index Grouping (OIG)
- **Assessment Method**: Third-party certification assessment conducted by authorized CMMC Third-Party Assessment Organizations (C3PAOs)
- **Higher Assurance**: Requires external validation of cybersecurity implementation

## CUI Classification and Registry Determination

**NARA CUI Registry**: The authoritative source maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration that catalogs all categories and subcategories of Controlled Unclassified Information across the federal government.

**Defense Organizational Index Grouping (OIG)**: A subset within the NARA CUI Registry specifically identifying CUI categories that are particularly sensitive to Department of Defense operations and mission requirements.

**Multiple Criteria Impact**: When CUI meets multiple classification criteria, the contractor must align to the highest applicable CMMC level requirement.

## Decision Process Flowchart Logic

**Step 1**: Determine if the contractor processes, stores, or transmits CUI

- **No CUI**: CMMC Level 1 (Self-Assessment) for FCI only
- **Yes CUI**: Proceed to Step 2

**Step 2**: Verify if the CUI appears in the NARA CUI Registry and Defense OIG

- **CUI in NARA Registry only**: CMMC Level 2 (Self-Assessment)
- **CUI in both NARA Registry AND Defense OIG**: CMMC Level 2 (Certification)

## Higher CMMC Levels Consideration

**Level 3 Potential**: Information meeting specific criteria may require higher CMMC levels beyond Level 2. When CUI meets multiple sensitivity criteria, contractors must implement controls corresponding to the highest applicable CMMC level.

**Risk-Based Assessment**: The determination considers the sensitivity and criticality of the information to national security and defense operations.

## Implementation Requirements

**Contract Specification**: CMMC level requirements are specified in individual solicitations and contracts based on the information types the contractor will handle.

**System Scope**: The CMMC level applies to the contractor's information systems that will process, store, or transmit the specified government information.

**Compliance Timeline**: Contractors must achieve the required CMMC level before contract award or within specified timeframes outlined in contract terms.

## Key References and Validation

**Authoritative Sources**:

- NARA CUI Registry for definitive CUI categorization
- DoD memoranda specifying CMMC level selection criteria
- Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.204-21 for Level 1 requirements

**Verification Process**: Contractors should consult the official DoD CMMC documentation and the NARA CUI Registry to accurately determine their required CMMC level based on the specific information types they will handle under contract.

This systematic approach ensures defense contractors implement appropriate cybersecurity measures commensurate with the sensitivity of government information they handle, supporting the overall security of the Defense Industrial Base.

# Technical Implementation of CMMC Requirements - ESPs, Asset Categories, and VDI

## What are the key technical considerations for implementing CMMC requirements?

The Technical Implementation of CMMC Requirements covers critical operational aspects of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification program, focusing on External Service Providers (ESPs), asset categorization, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), and specialized asset management. These technical implementation details determine how organizations scope their assessments, manage third-party services, and handle different asset types within their CMMC compliance framework.

**Primary Focus Areas**: ESP scoping requirements, Security Protection Assets (SPAs) and Security Protection Data (SPD) management, VDI configurations, and asset category differences between CMMC levels.

## External Service Provider (ESP) Scoping Framework

**ESP Definition**: External companies providing services to organizations seeking CMMC assessment, including Managed Service Providers (MSPs), Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

**Scoping Decision Matrix**:

### When ESP Processes, Stores, or Transmits CUI:

**Cloud Service Providers**: Must meet FedRAMP Moderate or equivalent requirements per DFARS 252.204-7012
**Non-Cloud ESPs**: Services fall within Organization Seeking Assessment (OSA) scope and must be assessed as part of OSA's assessment

### When ESP Handles Only Security Protection Data:

**Both CSPs and Non-CSPs**: Services included in OSA assessment scope and assessed as Security Protection Assets

### When ESP Handles Neither CUI nor SPD:

**All ESPs**: Do not meet CMMC definition of ESP and are out of scope

## Cloud Service Provider vs. Managed Service Provider Distinctions

**Clear CSP Indicators**:

- Company markets itself as "__aaS" (Something-as-a-Service)
- Subscription-based service with rapid provisioning capabilities
- Customer can independently make changes and spin up/down resources

**Clear Non-CSP Indicators**:

- Hardware hosting in colocation or datacenter
- Data hosting similar to shared drives on local networks
- Traditional IT staff augmentation services

**Gray Area Determination**:

- Depends on relationships between CSP, MSP, and OSA
- MSP becomes CSP if they own cloud tenant and sub-divide for customers
- Must be documented and described in System Security Plan (SSP)

## Security Protection Assets (SPAs) and Security Protection Data (SPD)

**Security Protection Assets**: Assets providing security functions or capabilities to the OSA's CMMC Assessment Scope, including SIEM systems, vulnerability scanners, and EDR solutions.

**Security Protection Data**: Data stored or processed by SPAs used to protect the assessed environment, including:

- Configuration data required to operate SPAs
- Log files generated by or ingested by SPAs
- Asset configuration and vulnerability status data
- Administrative passwords for in-scope environments

**Key Update**: ESPs that only store SPD or provide SPAs without processing CUI do NOT require separate CMMC assessment or FedRAMP authorization.

## Asset Category Requirements by CMMC Level

### Level 2 Security Protection Assets:

**OSA Requirements**:

- Document in asset inventory
- Document asset treatment in SSP
- Include in network diagram of CMMC Assessment Scope
- Prepare for CMMC Level 2 assessment

**Assessment Requirements**: Assess against Level 2 security requirements relevant to capabilities provided

### Level 3 Security Protection Assets:

**Enhanced Requirements**: Same documentation requirements as Level 2 plus preparation for both Level 2 and Level 3 assessments
**Assessment Requirements**: Limited check against Level 2, full assessment against all relevant Level 3 requirements

## Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Configuration

**Out-of-Scope Classification**: VDI endpoints configured to prevent CUI processing, storage, or transmission beyond Keyboard/Video/Mouse data are considered Out-of-Scope Assets.

**Acceptable Configurations**:

- Use of tokens/certificates for authentication is permitted
- Properly configured to prevent CUI handling beyond KVM
- Subject to assessor verification of configuration

**Non-Compliant VDI**: Improperly configured VDI systems that allow CUI processing are treated as CUI assets requiring full assessment.

## Specialized Assets and Contractor Risk Managed Assets (CRMAs)

**Specialized Assets**: Assets that can process CUI but cannot be fully secured, including IoT devices, IIoT devices, Operational Technology (OT), Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), and Test Equipment.

**Level 2 Treatment**: Document in inventory and SSP showing risk-based management; no assessment against other CMMC requirements
**Level 3 Treatment**: Full documentation plus limited Level 2 check and complete Level 3 assessment

**Contractor Risk Managed Assets (CRMAs)**:

- Assets that CAN but are NOT INTENDED to process CUI due to security policies and practices
- Level 2: No assessment if sufficiently documented in SSP
- Level 3: CRMAs become CUI Assets requiring full assessment if in same scope

## ESP Service Categories and CMMC Implications

**Staff Augmentation Services**: IT help desk, onsite technicians, fractional CIO/CISO services - treated as OSA staff with SPD considerations for administrative passwords

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Physical servers, RDS environments, tailored VDI - included in assessment scope if processing CUI, with scoping boundaries dependent on isolation degree

**Managed Security Services**: SOC operations, incident response - treated as SPAs with specific Level 2 or Level 3 assessment requirements based on CMMC level

## Key Implementation Guidance

**Documentation Requirements**: All ESPs and asset categories require comprehensive documentation in asset inventory, SSP, and network diagrams
**Assessment Preparation**: Organizations must prepare ESPs and assets for assessment according to their specific CMMC level requirements
**Risk Management**: CRMAs require clear documentation of risk-based security policies to avoid full assessment requirements

**Contact Information**: osd.pentagon.dod-cio.mbx.cmmc-inquiries@mail.mil for technical implementation questions

This technical framework ensures defense contractors properly scope their CMMC assessments while effectively managing the complex relationships between internal systems, external service providers, and various asset categories within their cybersecurity compliance programs.
