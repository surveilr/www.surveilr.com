# Opsfolio

## What is Opsfolio and how does it work?

Opsfolio is a compliance automation platform that helps companies pass cybersecurity audits and obtain certifications like SOC2, HIPAA, ISO, CMMC, FedRAMP, and HITRUST. The company combines expert human guidance with AI automation and a "Compliance-as-Code" methodology to deliver guaranteed compliance outcomes rather than just providing software tools.

## Core Value Proposition

Opsfolio positions itself as "More than software. Better than consultants" by offering three integrated services:

1. **Expert-Guided Compliance**: Real compliance engineers provide fractional Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) services, compliance coaching, expert policy authoring, and audit preparation support.
2. **AI-Driven Policy & Evidence Tools**: Intelligent automation that generates compliance evidence from existing workflows, including automated evidence collection, policy generation, gap analysis, and real-time monitoring.
3. **Unified System of Record**: A centralized platform managing all compliance data, policies, controls, and audit trails with unified dashboards and audit readiness scoring.

## Compliance-as-Code Methodology

Opsfolio's distinctive approach treats compliance like software development. Individual Contributors (ICs) such as architects, engineers, QA specialists, and customer success teams can continue their regular work while Opsfolio automatically generates compliance evidence from artifacts they already produce - including code, test results, and customer feedback. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, eliminating duplicate compliance work.

Key features include:

- Code-first compliance evidence generation
- Version-controlled policies treated like code
- Automated evidence collection from development workflows
- Team-centric approach that doesn't disrupt core responsibilities

## Technology Foundation: surveilr

The platform is powered by surveilr, a downloadable single binary that runs securely on Windows, Linux, and macOS within customer infrastructure. This creates a "Compliance Evidence Warehouse" - a SQL-queryable private data warehouse that can operate on laptops with minimal IT support.

surveilr provides:

- Local-first, edge-based evidence collection
- SQL queryable data warehouse
- Private and secure data handling (data stays with the customer)
- Continuous surveillance and evidence collection
- Machine attestable, auditable evidence
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Competitive Differentiation

Compared to traditional compliance tools like Vanta and Drata, Opsfolio offers:

- Compliance-as-Code approach vs. DIY software tools
- Guaranteed compliance outcomes vs. software license with uncertain results
- 60% faster implementation via automated evidence collection
- Fractional CCO support and AI-powered insights vs. documentation and chat support
- Machine attestation where CI/CD pipelines become compliance evidence engines

## Target Market and Results

Opsfolio serves companies needing regulatory compliance certifications, particularly those with engineering-focused teams. The company claims:

- 500+ client companies
- 98% audit pass rate
- Ability to achieve SOC2 Type 2 certification in 2 months
- 60% faster compliance implementation compared to traditional methods

## Business Model

The platform combines human expertise (fractional compliance officers), AI automation for evidence collection and policy generation, and a technical infrastructure (surveilr) that maintains customer data privacy while enabling automated compliance reporting and machine attestation for auditors.

# Opsfolio FedRAMP Compliance Solution

## What is Opsfolio's FedRAMP offering and how does it help cloud service providers?

Opsfolio provides a comprehensive Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) compliance platform specifically designed to help cloud service providers (CSPs) achieve federal government authorization for their cloud offerings. FedRAMP is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services, enabling agencies to use modern cloud technologies while maintaining security standards. Opsfolio streamlines the complex FedRAMP authorization process, helping organizations achieve authorization in 12-18 months.

**Understanding FedRAMP Authorization Paths:**

Opsfolio's platform supports all three primary FedRAMP authorization paths. The Agency Authorization (ATO) path allows cloud service providers to work directly with a federal agency sponsor, providing a faster path to market with agency-specific authorization that can be leveraged by other agencies through reciprocity. The Joint Authorization Board (JAB) path involves comprehensive review for broad government adoption and provides the widest market access across federal agencies. The FedRAMP Ready path involves independent security assessment to demonstrate FedRAMP readiness and prepares organizations for either agency or JAB authorization paths.

Each path addresses specific FISMA impact levels (Low, Moderate, and High) with corresponding security control requirements. Opsfolio's platform automatically maps these controls and helps organizations understand which path aligns best with their business objectives and target government customers.

**Opsfolio's FedRAMP Solution Features:**

Opsfolio automates the complex FedRAMP compliance process through comprehensive security control implementation, evidence collection, and audit preparation capabilities. The platform provides pre-built security control templates that align with NIST SP 800-53 requirements, automated System Security Plan (SSP) generation, and continuous monitoring tools required for maintaining FedRAMP authorization.

The system includes automated documentation generation for required FedRAMP deliverables including the SSP, Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M), Security Assessment Report (SAR), and Continuous Monitoring reports. It integrates with cloud infrastructure to automatically collect evidence, maintain audit trails, and provide real-time compliance dashboards that demonstrate ongoing security posture to authorizing officials.

**Business Impact and Government Market Access:**

FedRAMP authorization is mandatory for cloud service providers seeking to serve federal government customers. The FedRAMP Marketplace is a searchable database of cloud service offerings that have achieved FedRAMP designation, and federal agencies can only procure cloud services from this authorized list. Opsfolio's solution directly enables access to the $50+ billion federal cloud market by ensuring cloud service providers meet required security standards.

The platform helps organizations maintain continuous authorization through ongoing compliance monitoring, not just achieve one-time approval. This is critical because FedRAMP requires continuous monitoring and regular security assessments to maintain authorization status. Organizations using Opsfolio can demonstrate their security maturity to federal customers and maintain their competitive position in government contracts.

**Target Users and Implementation:**

Opsfolio's FedRAMP solution is designed for cloud service providers of all sizes, from startups to enterprise companies, who want to serve federal government customers. This includes Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers, as well as traditional IT companies transitioning to cloud-based government services.

The platform is particularly valuable for organizations that lack dedicated FedRAMP expertise or resources to navigate the complex authorization process independently. It provides step-by-step guidance through the authorization process, automated control implementation tracking, and preparation tools for Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) assessments required for FedRAMP authorization.

**Technical Integration and Compliance Management:**

Opsfolio integrates with major cloud platforms including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to provide centralized FedRAMP compliance management. The platform automatically inherits controls from FedRAMP-authorized infrastructure services and helps organizations understand their shared responsibility model for security controls.

The solution supports the entire FedRAMP lifecycle from initial readiness assessment through authorization maintenance. It provides automated reporting capabilities that align with FedRAMP requirements and helps organizations prepare for initial 3PAO assessments, annual assessments, and continuous monitoring activities required to maintain authorization.

**Security Control Implementation and Evidence Collection:**

Opsfolio automates the implementation and documentation of the hundreds of security controls required for FedRAMP authorization. The platform maps NIST SP 800-53 controls to specific business processes and technical implementations, automatically collecting evidence of control effectiveness from connected systems and maintaining the detailed audit trails required by FedRAMP assessors.

The system provides real-time visibility into control implementation status, identifies gaps that need remediation, and generates the detailed documentation packages required for FedRAMP submission. This includes automated generation of control implementation statements, evidence collection, and vulnerability management tracking that demonstrates ongoing security effectiveness.

**Regulatory Timeline and Market Opportunities:**

The federal government continues to expand cloud adoption, with FedRAMP being the mandatory pathway for cloud service authorization. Recent initiatives emphasize faster authorization timelines and streamlined processes, making efficient compliance management increasingly important for cloud providers seeking government customers.

Opsfolio's 12-18 month authorization timeline helps organizations capitalize on federal cloud opportunities while ensuring comprehensive security implementation. The platform stays current with evolving FedRAMP requirements and guidance, automatically updating control mappings and assessment criteria as the program continues to develop.
