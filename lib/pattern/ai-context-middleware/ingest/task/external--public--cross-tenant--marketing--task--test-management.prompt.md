# Qualityfolio Evidence-Driven Test Management Solution

## What is Qualityfolio's test management offering?

Qualityfolio is Opsfolio's AI-native, evidence-driven test management platform that transforms testing from a development activity into a compliance cornerstone. The solution provides markdown-based test authoring, AI-powered test generation, and integration with surveilr for audit-ready evidence collection. Qualityfolio is designed for compliance-driven organizations that need to demonstrate comprehensive test coverage, maintain traceability to requirements, and provide immutable audit trails for SOC 2, FDA validation, ISO 27001, and other regulatory frameworks that require structured test documentation and evidence of execution.

## Core Evidence-Driven Test Management Features

**Markdown-Based Test Authoring:**
