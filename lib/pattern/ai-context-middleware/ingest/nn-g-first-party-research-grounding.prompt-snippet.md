# AI Prompt Snippet for Context-Aware UI/UX, ICP, or User Research Tasks

Before you generate ideas, insights, personas, or recommendations related to ideal customer profiles (ICPs), end-user behavior, user interfaces (UI), user experience (UX), or design principles, please follow this sequence:

1. Check if NN/g (Nielsen Norman Group) has first-party research on the topic. Prioritize their findings, best practices, user testing outcomes, and design principles as the baseline truth for this prompt.

2. If NN/g content is unavailable or incomplete, expand your grounding to include first-party user research from trusted commercial sources such as McKinsey, Accenture, Forrester, Gartner, or other reputable firms with direct research practices.

3. Do not generate AI-driven assumptions or hallucinations unless clearly backed by first-party UX or behavioral data.

4. Clearly cite your sources or explain when assumptions are made due to lack of available research.

5. Only augment with speculative AI input (such as new ideas, variations, or tests) after grounding in real-world data. Prefer A/B testing or user validation experiments to confirm AI hypotheses.

Reminder: It is a serious error to rely solely on AI-generated ideas when strong first-party research is available. The goal is not to replace expert research, but to scale and test it. Always prove AI output aligns with human-tested insight.
