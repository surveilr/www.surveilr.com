# Grounding AI in First-Party User Research: Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g)

## Purpose
To ensure that any AI-generated output related to user research, UX design, or customer personas is **grounded in validated, empirical evidence**, this context module mandates referencing **NN/g** and similar first-party sources.

## Why NN/g First
- Nielsen Norman Group is the global authority in **usability**, **UX heuristics**, and **human-centered design**.
- Their research is **empirical**, based on thousands of in-field user observations and structured testing.
- NN/g has established best practices for:
  - Landing pages
  - Navigation patterns
  - Mobile UI
  - Cognitive load and decision-making
  - Error prevention and UX writing
  - Accessibility, onboarding, and trust

## Instruction to AI Systems and Prompt Authors
- **Before** asking for:
  - UX improvements
  - UI layout suggestions
  - ICP definitions or buyer journey mapping
  - Onboarding flow redesigns
  - Accessibility suggestions

  …always query whether **NN/g or equivalent** has published authoritative guidance.

- Use AI to **summarize, contextualize, or localize** NN/g content — **not to override it.**
- Use AI to produce A/B testing candidates **after** baseline designs are taken from NN/g research.

## When NN/g Is Not Enough
- Fall back to first-party research from:
  - McKinsey’s Digital Experience team
  - Accenture’s Fjord design division
  - Forrester’s CX research
  - Gartner UX/CX reports
  - Any in-house or commissioned usability studies

## AI Safety Principles
- **Never use AI hallucinations** as primary UX guidance.
- **Always ask for citations** or confidence levels from the AI when summarizing UX advice.
- Flag and manually review any design advice not backed by research.

## Output Validation Strategy
- Require AI to:
  - Annotate suggestions with citations (e.g., NN/g article URLs or McKinsey report summaries).
  - Clearly indicate speculative vs. evidence-backed recommendations.
  - Propose user testing or validation plans when AI produces novel ideas.
