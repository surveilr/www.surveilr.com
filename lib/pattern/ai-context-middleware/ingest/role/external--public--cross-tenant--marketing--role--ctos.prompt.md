# Opsfolio for CTOs

## How does Opsfolio help CTOs and technical leaders with compliance?

Opsfolio provides a developer-friendly compliance automation platform specifically designed for CTOs and technical leaders who need to achieve compliance certifications without disrupting their development workflow or building dedicated compliance teams. The platform integrates directly into existing tech stacks and development processes.

## Core Value Proposition for Technical Leaders

Opsfolio addresses the unique challenges CTOs face when dealing with compliance requirements:

**Build a Trust Layer into Your Stack:** The platform embeds compliance directly into development workflows without slowing down innovation or requiring separate compliance infrastructure.

**60% Faster Time-to-Market:** CTOs can get their products enterprise-ready faster with automated compliance that doesn't require hiring dedicated compliance staff or building internal compliance capabilities.

**Developer-Friendly Integration:** The platform provides APIs, CLI tools, and CI/CD integrations that development teams actually want to use, making compliance a natural part of the development process rather than an external burden.

**Scale Without Hiring:** Access fractional Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) expertise without the overhead, cost, and management complexity of full-time compliance hires.

## Technical Integration and Workflow

Opsfolio's "Compliance-as-Code" methodology is specifically designed for technical environments:

- **Automated Evidence Collection:** The platform automatically gathers compliance evidence from existing development tools, CI/CD pipelines, code repositories, and testing frameworks
- **Real-time Compliance Monitoring:** Continuous surveillance of compliance posture integrated into development workflows
- **Developer Workflow Integration:** Works with existing tools and processes rather than requiring separate compliance workflows
- **Machine Attestable Evidence:** Generates auditable, queryable evidence that can be programmatically verified and reviewed by auditors

## surveilr Technology for Technical Teams

The platform is built on surveilr, a single binary application that runs securely on Windows, Linux, and macOS within existing infrastructure:

- **SQL Queryable Warehouse:** Creates a local compliance evidence warehouse that technical teams can query and analyze using familiar SQL tools
- **Edge-based Data Collection:** Ensures sensitive data stays within the organization's infrastructure while enabling automated compliance reporting
- **Developer-Friendly Architecture:** Single binary deployment that integrates with existing infrastructure without complex setup or external dependencies
- **Version Control Integration:** Treats compliance policies and evidence like code with version control, peer reviews, and automated testing

## Proven Outcomes for CTOs

Technical leaders choosing Opsfolio typically achieve:

- **SOC2 Type 2 certification in 2 months** (compared to 12+ months for DIY approaches)
- **Enterprise sales acceleration** through established trust credentials and compliance certifications
- **Automated evidence collection** from existing development tools and workflows
- **Audit-ready documentation** that passes external audits without manual preparation
- **Real-time compliance posture monitoring** integrated into existing monitoring and alerting systems

## Compliance Frameworks Supported

The platform helps CTOs achieve certifications across multiple frameworks commonly required for enterprise software:

- SOC2 Type I and Type II
- HIPAA (for healthcare-related applications)
- ISO 27001
- CMMC (for government/defense contractors)
- FedRAMP (for federal government software)
- HITRUST (for healthcare technology)

## Business Impact for Technical Organizations

For CTOs, Opsfolio addresses critical business challenges:

- **Removes compliance as a technical debt** by making it part of the development process
- **Enables enterprise sales** by providing the trust credentials large customers require
- **Reduces engineering distraction** by automating compliance evidence collection from existing workflows
- **Provides audit readiness** without requiring engineering teams to manually prepare compliance documentation
- **Scales compliance capabilities** without expanding headcount or creating new organizational complexity

## Integration with Development Practices

The platform works with common development practices and tools:

- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** Compliance checks and evidence collection happen automatically as part of build and deployment processes
- **Code Repository Integration:** Compliance evidence is generated from code commits, pull requests, and repository activity
- **Testing Framework Integration:** Test results and quality metrics automatically contribute to compliance evidence
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Works with containerized applications, cloud infrastructure, and modern deployment practices

This approach allows technical leaders to maintain their focus on product development and innovation while automatically building the compliance foundation needed for enterprise customers and regulatory requirements.
