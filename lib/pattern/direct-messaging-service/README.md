# Direct Messaging Service

This project is designed to facilitate the secure exchange of clinical data
using the phiMail service. The project comprises four main modules, each serving
a distinct purpose within the overall system. These modules work together to
send, receive, process, and analyze clinical messages in a secure and efficient
manner.

# PhiMail Overview

PhiMail is a secure messaging service that facilitates the exchange of protected
health information (PHI) in compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA.
It is designed to support healthcare providers, organizations, and other
stakeholders in securely transmitting health-related data, ensuring both privacy
and integrity.

# Key Features

Compliance with HIPAA: PhiMail ensures that all communications involving PHI
meet the stringent requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA). This includes encryption of data in transit, secure
storage, and proper handling of sensitive information.

DIRECT Protocol Support: PhiMail is built on the DIRECT protocol, a standardized
method for secure email communication in healthcare. This enables seamless and
secure transmission of health information between different systems and
organizations, such as hospitals, laboratories, and physician offices.

Encryption and Security: PhiMail utilizes robust encryption mechanisms to
protect data, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the information.
This includes the use of SSL/TLS for secure connections and digital signatures
to verify the authenticity of messages.

Interoperability: PhiMail supports interoperability with various healthcare
systems, enabling the exchange of data in different formats like CDA (Clinical
Document Architecture). This allows for smooth integration with electronic
health records (EHR) systems and other health information exchanges (HIEs).

Message Tracking and Acknowledgments: PhiMail provides detailed tracking of
message delivery, including delivery status and read receipts. This is crucial
in healthcare settings, where confirmation of receipt and action on
health-related messages is often required.

Scalability and Customization: PhiMail can be tailored to the specific needs of
healthcare organizations, whether they require a standalone messaging solution
or integration with existing systems. It is scalable to accommodate the needs of
small practices as well as large healthcare networks.

Secure Attachments: PhiMail supports the secure exchange of attachments, such as
medical records, lab results, and other documents. These attachments are
encrypted and can be managed securely within the platform.

# Use Cases

Clinical Communication: Facilitates the exchange of medical records, referrals,
and other critical health information between providers, ensuring timely and
secure communication.

Laboratory Results: Enables labs to send results directly to providers,
integrating seamlessly with EHR systems for quick access.

Patient Communication: Allows healthcare providers to securely send and receive
information directly with patients, such as test results, care instructions, or
appointment reminders.

# Message Sender Module

The Message Sender Module is responsible for sending direct messages containing
clinical data. This module ensures that the messages are securely transmitted to
the intended recipients using the phiMail service.

# `surveilr` Direct Messaging Service Patterns

- `stateless.sql` script focuses on creating views that define how to extract
  and present specific direct messaging data from the `uniform_resource.content`
  JSONB column. It does not modify or store any persistent data; it only sets up
  views for querying.

## Try it out on any device without this repo (if you're just using the SQL scripts)

Prepare the directory with sample files, download direct message inbox samples,
download surveilr, and create resource-surveillance.sqlite.db RSSD file that
will contain queryable direct message inbox content data and attachments
including pdf and CCDA xml files.

```bash
# prepare a working directory
$ mkdir -p /tmp/direct-messages
$ cd /tmp/direct-messages
```

Prepare the sample files for ingestion

```bash
# download the sample direct messages zip file using the below command.
$ wget https://github.com/surveilr/www.surveilr.com/raw/main/lib/pattern/direct-messaging-service/ingest.zip
```

Extract the zip file

```bash
$ unzip ./ingest.zip
```

Once unzipped, you should see the sample files in the ingest folder. The
'direct-messages' directory structure should look like this:

```bash
direct-messages
├── ingest
    ├── 00000191-31c8-a179-d9f7-ae67ed7c3b80_20240808171502355_sample.xml
    ├── 20240808171534044_messageDeliveryStatus.json
    ├── 00000191-31c8-a179-d9f7-ae67ed7c3b80_20240808171502355_content.json
    └── 00000191-31c8-a179-d9f7-ae67ed7c3b80_20240808171502355_sample.pdf
```

Now
[Download `surveilr` binary](https://docs.opsfolio.com/surveilr/how-to/installation-guide/)
into 'direct-messages' directory, then ingest and query the data:

```bash
# ingest the files in the "ingest/" directory, creating resource-surveillance.sqlite.db
$ ./surveilr ingest files -r ingest/
```

After ingestion your directory structure should look like this

```
direct-messages
├── ingest
│   ├── 00000191-31c8-a179-d9f7-ae67ed7c3b80_20240808171502355_sample.xml
|   ├── 20240808171534044_messageDeliveryStatus.json
│   ├── 00000191-31c8-a179-d9f7-ae67ed7c3b80_20240808171502355_content.json
│   └── 00000191-31c8-a179-d9f7-ae67ed7c3b80_20240808171502355_sample.pdf
└── resource-surveillance.sqlite.db            # SQLite database
```

Post-ingestion, `surveilr` is no longer required, the `ingest` directory can be
ignored, only `sqlite3` is required because all content is in the
`resource-surveillance.sqlite.db` SQLite database which does not require any
other dependencies.

```bash
# use SQLPage to preview content (be sure `deno` v1.40 or above is installed)
$ surveilr shell https://surveilr.com/lib/pattern/direct-messaging-service/package.sql

$ surveilr web-ui --port 9000
# launch a browser and go to http://localhost:9000/dms/index.sql
```

Once you ingest all the files using `surveilr`, apply `stateless.sql` all
content will be accessed through views or `*.cached` tables in
`resource-surveillance.sqlite.db`.

At this point you can rename the SQLite database file, archive it, use in
reporting tools, DBeaver, DataGrip, or any other SQLite data access tools.

## Try it out in this repo (if you're developing SQL scripts)

### Clone the Repository

- Clone the repository containing the necessary scripts:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/surveilr/www.surveilr.com.git
  ```

### Change to the Cloned Directory

- After cloning, navigate to the repository folder:
  ```bash
  cd lib/pattern//direct-messaging-service
  ```

### Prepare the Sample Files for Ingestion

wget
https://github.com/surveilr/www.surveilr.com/raw/main/lib/pattern/direct-messaging-service/ingest.zip

#### Extract the Zip File

Before beginning the ingestion process, extract the sample files from the zip
archive named `ingest.zip`.

### Verify the Directory Structure

Once unzipped, you should see the sample files in the ingest folder. The
'direct-messaging-service' directory structure should look like this:

```
.
├── ingest
│   ├── 00000191-31c8-a179-d9f7-ae67ed7c3b80_20240808171502355_sample.xml
|   ├── 20240808171534044_messageDeliveryStatus.json
│   ├── 00000191-31c8-a179-d9f7-ae67ed7c3b80_20240808171502355_content.json
│   └── 00000191-31c8-a179-d9f7-ae67ed7c3b80_20240808171502355_sample.pdf
├── package.sql.ts
└── stateless.sql
```

Now
[Download `surveilr` binary](https://docs.opsfolio.com/surveilr/how-to/installation-guide/)
into 'direct-messaging-service' directory, then ingest and query the data:

```bash
# ingest the files in the "ingest/" directory, creating resource-surveillance.sqlite.db
$ ./surveilr ingest files -r ingest/
```

After ingestion, you will only work with these files:

```
├── stateless.sql
└── resource-surveillance.sqlite.db            # SQLite database
```

Post-ingestion, `surveilr` is no longer required, the `ingest` directory can be
ignored, only `sqlite3` is required because all content is in the
`resource-surveillance.sqlite.db` SQLite database which does not require any
other dependencies.

```bash
# load the "Console" and other menu/routing utilities plus FHIR Web UI (both are same, just run one)
$ deno run -A ./package.sql.ts | surveilr shell   # option 1 (same as option 2)
$ surveilr shell ./package.sql.ts                 # option 2 (same as option 1)

# start surveilr web-ui in "watch" mode to re-load package.sql.ts automatically
$ SQLPAGE_SITE_PREFIX=/lib/pattern/direct-messaging-service ../../std/surveilrctl.ts dev
# browse http://localhost:9000/ to see surveilr web UI
# browse http://localhost:9000/dms/info-schema.sql to see DMS-specific schema
```

Once you apply `stateless.sql` you can ignore that files and all content will be
accessed through views or `*.cached` tables in
`resource-surveillance.sqlite.db`. At this point you can rename the SQLite
database file, archive it, use in reporting tools, DBeaver, DataGrip, or any
other SQLite data access tools.

## Automatically reloading SQL when it changes

On sandboxes during development and editing of `.sql` or `.sql.ts` you may want
to automatically re-load the contents into SQLite regularly. Since it can be
time-consuming to re-run the same command in the CLI manually each time a file
changes, you can use _watch mode_ instead.

See: [`surveilrctl.ts`](../../std/surveilrctl.ts).

## How to Run the Tests

To execute test and ensure that `surveilr` is functioning correctly:

1. Run the tests using Deno:

   ```bash
   deno test -A  # Executes test
   ```

   This process will create an 'assurance' folder, where you can find the files
   related to the test, including the database and ingestion folder

The `-A` flag provides all necessary permissions for the tests to run, including
file system access and network permissions.
