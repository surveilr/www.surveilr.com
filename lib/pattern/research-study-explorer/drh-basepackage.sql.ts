The **Combined CGM Tracing** refers to a consolidated dataset of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, collected from multiple participants in a research study. CGM devices track glucose levels at regular intervals throughout the day, providing detailed insights into the participants'' glycemic control over time.

In a research study, this combined dataset is crucial for analyzing glucose trends across different participants and understanding overall patterns in response to interventions or treatments. The **Combined CGM Tracing** dataset typically includes:
- **Participant ID**: A unique identifier for each participant, ensuring the data is de-identified while allowing for tracking individual responses.
- **Date_Time**: The timestamp for each CGM reading, formatted uniformly to allow accurate time-based analysis.(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- **CGM_Value**: The recorded glucose level at each time point, often converted to a standard unit (e.g., mg/dL or mmol/L) and stored as a real number for precise calculations.

This combined view enables researchers to perform comparative analyses, evaluate glycemic variability, and assess overall glycemic control across participants, which is essential for understanding the efficacy of treatments or interventions in the study. By aggregating data from multiple sources, researchers can identify population-level trends while maintaining the integrity of individual data.

## Participant Information

Participants are individuals who volunteer to take part in CGM research studies. Their data is crucial for evaluating the performance of CGM systems and their impact on diabetes management.

### Participant Details

  - **Participant ID**: A unique identifier assigned to each participant.
  - **Study ID**: A unique identifier for the study in which the participant is involved.
  - **Site ID**: The identifier for the site where the participant is enrolled.
  - **Diagnosis ICD**: The diagnosis code based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system.
  - **Med RxNorm**: The medication code based on the RxNorm system.
  - **Treatment Modality**: The type of treatment or intervention administered to the participant.
  - **Gender**: The gender of the participant.
  - **Race Ethnicity**: The race and ethnicity of the participant.
  - **Age**: The age of the participant.
  - **BMI**: The Body Mass Index (BMI) of the participant.
  - **Baseline HbA1c**: The baseline Hemoglobin A1c level of the participant.
  - **Diabetes Type**: The type of diabetes diagnosed for the participant.
  - **Study Arm**: The study arm or group to which the participant is assigned.
