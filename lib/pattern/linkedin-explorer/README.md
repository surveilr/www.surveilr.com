# `surveilr` Information Controls Explorer Pattern

Information Controls, refer to specific security, compliance, or operational
measures that organizations put in place to manage risks related to information
systems and data handling.

- `stateless.sql` script focuses on creating views that define how to extract
  and present specific controls data from the `uniform_resource.csv` tables.

- `package.sql.ts` script is the entry point for loading typical database
  objects and Web UI content.

  ## Try it out on any device without this repo (if you're just using the SQL scripts)

  The directory should look like this now:

```
├── orchestrate-stateful.sql
├── stateless.sql 
└── resource-surveillance.sqlite.db            # SQLite database
```

Post-ingestion, `surveilr` is no longer required, the `ingest` directory can be
ignored, only `sqlite3` is required because all content is in the
`resource-surveillance.sqlite.db` SQLite database which does not require any
other dependencies.

```bash
# load the "Console" and other menu/routing utilities plus ic Web UI (both are same, just run one)
$ deno run -A ./package.sql.ts | surveilr shell   # option 1 (same as option 2)
$ surveilr shell ./package.sql.ts                 # option 2 (same as option 1)

# start surveilr web-ui in "watch" mode to re-load package.sql.ts automatically
$ ../../std/surveilrctl.ts dev
# browse http://localhost:9000/ to see surveilr web UI
# browse http://localhost:9000/info-assurance-controls/info-schema.sql to see ic-specific views and tables
```

## How to Run the Tests

To execute test and ensure that `surveilr` is functioning correctly:

1. Run the tests using Deno:

   ```bash
   deno test -A  # Executes test
   ```

   This process will create an 'assurance' folder, where you can find the files
   related to the test, including the database and ingestion folder

The `-A` flag provides all necessary permissions for the tests to run, including
file system access and network permissions.

## How to Run the Tap Tests

### RUN THIS TEST this using CLI

`rm -f tap.sql &&  deno run -A ./tap.sql.ts > tap.sql`

This will generate a tap.sql file from tap.sql.ts

`cat tap.sql | sqlite3 resource-surveillance.sqlite.db && sqlite3 resource-surveillance.sqlite.db -cmd "
SELECT * FROM synthetic_test_suite;"`

This script demonstrates how to create a Test Anything Protocol (TAP) report
using SQLite, following TAP version 14. It includes multiple test cases, and
subtests are formatted with indentation per TAP 14's subtest style.
