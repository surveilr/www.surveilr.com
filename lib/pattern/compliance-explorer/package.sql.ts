      Policy Audit Prompt 
      <br>
      Ensure your policies stay effective and compliant with the "Policy Audit Prompt". These prompts are designed to help users critically evaluate existing policies against standards, frameworks, and internal expectations. By running an audit prompt, you can identify gaps, inconsistencies, or outdated language, and quickly adjust policies to remain audit-ready and regulator-approved. This gives your team a reliable tool for continuous policy improvement and compliance assurance.

      Generated Policies
      <br>
      The Generated Policies section showcases real examples of policies created using the "Policy Generator Prompt". These samples illustrate how high-level controls are translated into concrete, practical policy documents. Each generated policy highlights structure, clarity, and compliance alignment—making it easier for users to adapt and deploy them within their own organizations. Think of this as a living library of ready-to-use policy templates derived directly from controls.
