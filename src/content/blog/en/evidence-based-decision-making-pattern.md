**Evidence-based decision making** is the process of using data and factual
evidence to guide important business decisions, ensuring that choices are
grounded in reality rather than intuition or incomplete information. While this
approach is critical for success, executives often struggle with gathering
enough reliable evidence to make sound decisions. According to **Harvard
Business Review**, many executives lack the data they need for decision making,
which is often scattered across systems, incomplete, or difficult to access
[[HBR, 2020](https://hbr.org/2020/01/how-executives-can-make-better-decisions)].

The challenges of evidence-based decision making are exacerbated by the lack of
a unified approach to collecting **human-generated** and **machine-generated**
evidence. Most businesses today rely on a patchwork of systems that store data
in different formats, with no single platform capable of pulling everything
together into a cohesive, queryable format. This is where **`surveilr`** stands
out.

Unlike other tools that handle data exchanges but leave the data unorganized,
`surveilr` not only gathers data from multiple sources but also **organizes it
into a unified format** that is instantly queryable. This means that the
evidence collected—whether it's from emails, databases, SaaS tools, log files,
or industry-specific formats like HL7 or FHIR—can be queried and analyzed with
ease using **SQL-friendly tools**. For business analysts and executives, this
makes it much easier to extract insights, run reports, and make informed
decisions based on the evidence at hand.

Moreover, `surveilr` can act as a complete **evidence warehouse**. It securely
aggregates data behind firewalls, cleans and anonymizes it where necessary, and
allows for the **local storage of evidence** on devices as small as laptops. At
the same time, it can scale to support cloud-based evidence repositories,
ensuring secure, queryable access to data across the organization.

Other evidence-gathering tools on the market often fail to deliver this level of
organization. They may facilitate the transfer of data between systems but do
not prepare the data in a structured, **uniformly queryable format**.
**`surveilr`**, on the other hand, is designed specifically to handle this
challenge, ensuring that evidence-based decision making becomes a smoother, more
efficient process.

In today's fast-paced business environment, where executives need access to
trustworthy data to make informed decisions, **`surveilr`** delivers the
unified, secure, and queryable platform that makes evidence-based decision
making possible.
