Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.27.0

## What's New
---

### 1. Extra Logging for `surveilr shell`
  - Emit error messages to STDERR.
  - Added `--silent` (defaults to false) to prevent the emitting error messages to `stderr`.
  - Added a new argument called `--emit-session-id` which when true would put the orchestration session ID to STDOUT.

### 2. Fleshed out error loggings
 - All related `orchestration_*` tables have now been utilized to properly fill in error details for proper tracking
 -  `surveilr shell diagnose` generates an English-like log which explains precisely what happened for the last log entry. An optional `session-id` can be specified to get details for that session.

### 3. `surveilr` specific SQLite functions
 - Mathematical functions like `sine`, `cosine` and a lot more have been implemented.
 - String functions
