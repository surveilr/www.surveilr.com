Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.31.0

## Bug Fixes
---

### 1. Surveilr Shell Bug with RSSD File Size Increase

- **Issue**: A blocker bug in the surveilr shell caused unnecessary increases in the file size of RSSDs. Running the same idempotent, e.g. `package.sql.ts` file multiple times in SQLite left the database unchanged, but doing so in the surveilr shell dramatically increased file sizes.
- **Impact**: The larger the RSSD, the worse the issue became. This was particularly problematic for idempotent scripts.
- **Short-Term Fix**: The migration SQL script execution was prevented from running on every execution, which has stopped the unnecessary file size increases.
- **Long-Term Solution**: Fully working migration code will be available in the next release.

### 2. File Format Support for Ingestion

- **New Support Added**: The ingestion process now supports additional file formats:
  - PDF (`.pdf`)
  - PowerPoint (`.ppt`, `.pptx`)
  - Word Documents (`.doc`, `.docx`)
  - Excel Files (`.xls`, `.xlsx`)

### 3. Fixed Uniform Resource Table Query Bug

- **Issue**: There was no clear way to query and retrieve the latest file content from the `uniform_resource` table, especially after reverting a file to a previous state. Additionally, the `updated_at` field remained empty for all entries, making it difficult to track file version updates.
- **Fix**: The bug was fixed by adding the `updated_at` field in the `ON CONFLICT` query part, ensuring proper tracking of file version updates.
