Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.30.1

## Bug Fixes
---

### 1. `surveilr shell` execution for remote URL SQL on Windows
The previous version of `surveilr` threw errors when executing scripts through `shell` on Windows machines due to file sync error on the RSSD. This release fixes this bug.
