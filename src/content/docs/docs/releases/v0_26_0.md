Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.26.0

## What's New
---

### 1. **Extra Logging for `surveilr shell`**
  - Emit error messages to STDERR.
  - Added `--silent` (defaults to false) to prevent the emitting error messages to `stderr`.
  - Added a new argument called `--emit-session-id` which when true would put the orchestration session ID to STDOUT.
