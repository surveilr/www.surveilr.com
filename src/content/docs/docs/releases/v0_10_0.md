Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.10.0

## What's New
1. **Orchestration models**
    - [x] `device` – `surveilr` already has a `device` table but check to see if we need to enhance it.
    - [x] Add a table called `orchestration_nature` with a `orchestration_nature_id` TEXT ID primary key (not UUID), required `nature` TEXT, `elaboration` JSONB columns
        - [x] Start with a single default row with ` orchestration_nature_id` called `V&V` and `nature` called `Verification and Validation`
        - [x] We will start with one type of “orchestration” called “V&V” and then we will add more later after V&V is done
    - [x] `orch_session` -> use it as it but call it `orchestration_session`
         - [x] add a text column called `orchestration_nature_id` to this table and default it to `V&V` foreign key above.
    - [x] `orch_session_entry` -> `orchestration_session_entry`
    - [x] `orch_session_state` -> `orchestration_session_state`
    - [x] `orch_session_exec` -> `orchestration_session_exec`
    - [x] `orch_session_issue` -> `orchestration_session_issue`

## Bug Fixes
- **GitLab Batch Size**: The default used to be 20; however, it will now be determined by the `--batch-size` argument provided.
