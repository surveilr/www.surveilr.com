Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.27.0

## Bug Fixes
---

### 1. `surveilr shell` Logging Enhancements
  - Added to the elaboration field on the `orchestration_session` table, `start_size` and `final_size` to indicate the sizes of the RSSD pre and post orchestration.
  - When `surveilr shell diagnose` is executed, the resulting diagnosis is also stored in the `diagnostics_json` and `diagnostic_md` columns on the `orchestration_session` table for future references.
  - Fixed column issues with `surveilr shell diagnose`. Running the `diagnose` command failed in previous releases.
  - For `static stdin scripts`, in previous releases, the `url` field was empty, this release fixes it by adding a truncated section of the content as the `url` field.
