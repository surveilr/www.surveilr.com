Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.13.2

## What's New

### `surveilr admin merge` Enhancements

- **New Argument: `-table-name-patterns` or `-p`**
  - Introduced a new argument `-table-name-patterns` (or shorthand `-p`) to the
    `surveilr admin merge` command.
  - This argument allows users to specify a list of regular expressions to
    include specific table names in the merge process.
  - Example usage:
    ```bash
    surveilr admin merge -p "audit_session%" -p "activity_log%"
    ```

## Bug Fixes

### `surveilr orchestrate transform-csv` Command

  - Fixed an issue where the `surveilr orchestrate transform-csv` command would
    hang during execution.
