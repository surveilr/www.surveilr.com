Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.9.14

## Bug Fixes

1. **IMAP Email Attachments Extraction:** The extraction of email attachments
   has been enhanced to continue the process even if it encounters a specific
   message that fails. Previously, such a failure would halt the entire process.
   Now, `surveilr` will skip the problematic message, record it in `stdout`, and
   note it in the `elaboration` field.

2. **Automatic Data Reduction:** During `transforms`, the data is now
   automatically condensed by omitting the corresponding content from
   `uniform_resource`.
