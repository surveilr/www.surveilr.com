Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.13.1

### What's New

1. **Notebook Orchestration**
   - Introduced a powerful new feature that allows executing scripts stored
     within `code_notebook_cell`, similar to stored procedures.
   - You can use the `--notebook` (`-n`) and `--cell` (`-c`) arguments to select
     multiple notebooks and cells, orchestrating them in a single session.
   - The `-arg` flag now creates a temporary table
     `surveilr_orchestration_session_arg` with columns `session_id`, `key`, and
     `value`. All provided arguments are inserted as rows in this table,
     allowing the `code_notebook_cell` SQL code to leverage these inputs
     dynamically.

### Bug Fixes

- **Cargo-Metadata Command Failure**
  - Resolved an issue where all commands were failing due to `cargo-metadata`.
    This fix ensures stability and seamless execution of commands moving
    forward.
- **`surveilr doctor` fixes**
  - `surveilr doctor` only makes SQLite compulsory, all other dependencies are
    not required
