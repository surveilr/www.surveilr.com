Release notes for Resource Surveillance (`surveilr`) 0.13.4

## Bug Fixes

### Orchestration Scripts Execution

- The execution and management of orchestration scripts have been restored to
  their initial configuration. They are now being executed in batches. Please
  note that only DML queries will be processed. More complex scripts should be
  automated using Deno. Additionally, support for executing Deno scripts with
  `surveilr` will be introduced in the upcoming release.

## Assets
