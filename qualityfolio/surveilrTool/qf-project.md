### 1. Project Overview

The **Surveilr Data Ingestion and CLI Functional Validation** project focuses on verifying the reliability and consistency of Surveilr’s command-line and ingestion capabilities.  
It ensures that Surveilr’s CLI handles command execution, parameters, flags, exit codes, and logging as expected, while validating ingestion, parsing, and synchronization of multiple file types, multimedia content, and web/API data across different operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac).

This project provides comprehensive assurance that:  
- The CLI behaves predictably across success and failure conditions.  
- Ingestion and parsing workflows handle diverse formats (CSV, JSON, XML, ZIP/TAR.GZ, DOCX, XLSX, PDF, TXT, MD, RTF) accurately.  
- Multimedia files including Images (JPEG, PNG), Audio (MP3), and Video (MP4) are processed correctly.  
- Email (IMAP) ingestion is stable, secure, and properly processed.  
- Web and API content (HTML pages, website content, RSS feeds, APIs) are retrieved, parsed, and synchronized correctly.  
- Synchronization with third-party task management platforms maintains data integrity and consistency.  

**Business Value:**  
Ensures operational stability, supports data-driven insights, enhances automation reliability, improves content ingestion coverage, and reduces errors across Surveilr’s ecosystem on all major operating systems.

### 2. Scope

The project encompasses functional and integration testing of Surveilr’s ingestion, CLI, multimedia processing, web/API data handling, and synchronization subsystems. It covers command validation, multi-format data ingestion, multimedia handling, structured/unstructured data parsing, web/API content validation, and third-party system integrations across Windows, Linux, and Mac.

#### Key Focus Areas

- **Functional CLI Testing**  
  - Validate command execution, flag handling, and output accuracy.  
  - Verify exit codes, logging behavior, and error reporting across OS platforms.  

- **Email Ingestion (IMAP)**  
  - Validate secure retrieval, parsing, and processing of IMAP emails.  
  - Ensure correct handling of attachments and message metadata.  

- **Capturable Executable (CE) File Ingestion**  
  - Confirm proper upload, recognition, and processing of CE files.  
  - Validate logging, storage, and analysis consistency.  

- **Structured and Archived File Ingestion**  
  - Validate ingestion and parsing of CSV, JSON, YAML/YML, XML formats.  
  - Ensure extraction and analysis from ZIP and TAR.GZ archives.  

- **Office Document Management**  
  - Test ingestion, parsing, and data extraction from DOC/DOCX, XLS/XLSX, PPT/PPTX, and PDF files.  

- **Text-based File Handling**  
  - Validate ingestion of TXT, MD, and RTF files.  
  - Confirm correct parsing and content indexing.  

- **Multimedia File Processing**  
  - Images: JPEG, PNG  
  - Audio: MP3  
  - Video: MP4  
  - Validate metadata extraction, content integrity, and format compatibility.  

- **Web & API Data Ingestion**  
  - HTML pages, website content, RSS feeds, and web API responses.  
  - Validate parsing, mapping, and synchronization accuracy.  

- **Third-Party Task Synchronization**  
  - Verify ingestion and sync from GitLab, GitHub, Xray, Jira, Azure, AWS, OpenProject, and GCP.  
  - Validate mapping consistency, performance, and error handling.  

- **Cross-Platform Validation**  
  - Execute ingestion and CLI commands on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.  
  - Ensure consistent behavior, error handling, and reporting across platforms.

### 3. Quality Goals

- **Reliability:** Maintain consistent ingestion and execution outcomes across multiple file types, multimedia, web/API data, and command variations.  
- **Performance:** Optimize ingestion speed, multimedia processing, email handling, and synchronization latency.  
- **Security:** Ensure secure handling of sensitive data and credentials during ingestion and CLI operations.  
- **Scalability:** Validate handling of concurrent ingestion requests and bulk data processing.  
- **Interoperability:** Guarantee seamless connectivity with external task management, cloud systems, and web APIs.  
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Ensure identical functionality and reliability on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
