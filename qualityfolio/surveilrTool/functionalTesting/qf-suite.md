## Scope of Work

This test suite validates the **functional CLI behavior** and **multi-source ingestion workflows** of the Surveilr platform across **Windows, Linux, and Mac OS**.  
It ensures successful ingestion and processing of structured/unstructured data, IMAP emails, web content, and multimedia files, while verifying synchronization accuracy with external systems.  
The goal is to maintain **end-to-end reliability**, **data consistency**, and **operational resilience** across Surveilr’s ingestion and automation pipelines.

### Key Focus Areas
- Functional CLI execution, command flag handling, and logging across all supported OS  
- Structured file ingestion (CSV, JSON, YAML, XML)  
- Office document ingestion (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, PDF)  
- Text file ingestion (TXT, MD, RTF)  
- Archive extraction and processing (ZIP, TAR.GZ)  
- IMAP email ingestion and message parsing  
- Capturable Executable (CE) ingestion validation  
- **Web-Based Content Ingestion**  
  - HTML pages, website content, RSS feeds, and API-based data sources  
  - Retry handling and error resilience for invalid/unreachable URLs  
  - Metadata extraction and indexing validation  
- **Multimedia File Ingestion**  
  - Images: JPEG, PNG  
  - Audio: MP3  
  - Video: MP4  
  - Metadata extraction, integrity checks, and performance under concurrent uploads  
- Synchronization with third-party systems (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Azure, AWS, OpenProject, GCP)  
- Logging, error traceability, and result validation for all ingestion workflows  

---

## Test Objectives

- Verify CLI command accuracy, output consistency, and flag handling under varied parameters and OS environments.  
- Ensure ingestion pipelines process structured, unstructured, web/API, and multimedia content correctly.  
- Validate extraction, parsing, and indexing completeness across all supported file formats.  
- Test IMAP email ingestion, attachment handling, and duplicate prevention.  
- Confirm web-based ingestion and RSS/API data handling, including resilience for unreachable or malformed content.  
- Validate metadata extraction for multimedia ingestion and maintain system performance benchmarks.  
- Verify synchronization accuracy and latency across integrated third-party systems.  
- Ensure proper logging, error traceability, and diagnostic clarity for all ingestion events.  
- Confirm secure handling of data and compliance across all ingestion and synchronization workflows.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Test Lead:**  
  - Plan, organize, and oversee suite execution and reporting.  
  - Ensure full coverage of ingestion, web/API, multimedia, and CLI validation objectives.  
  - Review execution reports and approve final deliverables.  

- **Test Engineers:**  
  - Execute CLI, ingestion, and synchronization test cases via Playwright (TypeScript).  
  - Capture and document results, logs, and any failures.  
  - Validate ingestion accuracy and log consistency across workflows.  

- **Developers (Support Role):**  
  - Provide technical clarifications for ingestion, API, and synchronization modules.  
  - Support issue resolution and participate in triage sessions.  

- **Stakeholders / Reviewers:**  
  - Review outcome summaries and performance metrics.  
  - Validate key results and approve final test suite completion.

## Execution Strategy

- Execution will be performed using **Playwright (TypeScript)** for CLI, web-based, multimedia, and workflow validation.  
- Test datasets include structured (CSV, JSON, XML), unstructured (DOCX, PDF, TXT), archived (ZIP, TAR.GZ), multimedia (JPEG, PNG, MP3, MP4), and web/API content (HTML, RSS, API responses).  
- Web ingestion tests utilize predefined RSS feeds, HTML pages, and API endpoints.  
- Integration validation will use sandbox credentials for all connected systems.  
- Execution logs, screenshots, and JSON-formatted result files will be maintained for traceability.  
- All test scenarios will be executed on **Windows, Linux, and Mac** to validate cross-platform reliability.  

---

## Deliverables

- Executed test case results in structured JSON format  
- CLI command execution and log validation report  
- Structured/unstructured file ingestion test summary  
- Web/API content ingestion test report  
- Multimedia ingestion performance and validation report  
- IMAP email ingestion results and error logs  
- Integration and synchronization validation summary  
- Cross-platform test execution report  
- Final suite execution summary and sign-off report
