### Description
- Validate Surveiler behavior when Xray returns extremely large number of tasks (>10,000).

### Test Steps
1. Trigger ingestion with >10,000 tasks in Xray.  

### Expected Result
- Surveiler handles gracefully (batch processing or fails with proper error).  
- No crash or data corruption.  
- Logs reflect ingestion status.
