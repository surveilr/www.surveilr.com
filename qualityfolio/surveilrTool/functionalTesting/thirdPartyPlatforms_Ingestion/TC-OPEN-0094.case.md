### Description
- Validate how Surveilr handles ingestion of tasks that already exist in the system.

### Test Steps
1. Ingest a task from OpenProject into Surveilr.  
2. Run ingestion again for the same task ID.  
3. Observe Surveilrâ€™s handling of duplicates.  

### Expected Result
- Duplicate tasks are ignored or updated without data duplication.  
- System logs reflect duplicate detection with appropriate message.  
- No corruption of existing data occurs.
