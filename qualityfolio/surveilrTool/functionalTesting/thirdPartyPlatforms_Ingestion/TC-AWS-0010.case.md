### Description
- Simulate slow connection during large (20GB) dataset upload to test timeout handling.

### Test Steps
1. Start uploading 20GB dataset to S3.  
2. Introduce network latency.  
3. Monitor Surveilrâ€™s timeout and retry behavior.  
4. Inspect logs and stored files after completion.

### Expected Result
- Surveilr detects timeout and retries automatically.  
- No partial or corrupted files stored.  
- Upload resumes after network stabilization.
