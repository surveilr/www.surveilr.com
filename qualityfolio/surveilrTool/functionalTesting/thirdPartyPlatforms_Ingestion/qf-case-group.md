## Overview

This test case group defines a set of validation scenarios focused on **Surveilerâ€™s ingestion pipeline**, which pulls and synchronizes task data from diverse external systems.  
It ensures reliable data fetching, accurate field mapping, correct status transitions, and robust error handling for all supported integrations.

## Key Functional Areas

### ðŸ”¹ Source Connectivity & Authorization
- **API Authentication**
  - Validate successful authentication using access tokens or API keys for each platform.
  - Verify expired or invalid credentials generate appropriate error messages.
- **Connection Health**
  - Ensure each connector (GitLab, GitHub, Jira, etc.) can establish a stable connection.
  - Check connection retry behavior and timeout handling.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Task Ingestion & Synchronization
- **Initial Ingestion**
  - Confirm Surveiler can ingest tasks/issues from each platform successfully.
  - Verify correct field mapping (title, description, status, assignee, labels, etc.).
- **Incremental Sync**
  - Validate updated or new tasks are fetched without duplication.
  - Ensure deletions or status changes on source platforms reflect accurately.
- **Data Integrity**
  - Confirm no data loss or corruption during ingestion.
  - Validate task counts and metadata consistency post-ingestion.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Error Handling & Logging
- **Failure Scenarios**
  - Simulate network or API errors and verify retry and recovery mechanisms.
  - Ensure meaningful error messages and logs are generated for failed ingestions.
- **Alerting**
  - Validate Surveiler triggers notifications or alerts for repeated ingestion failures.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Performance & Scalability
- **Load Testing**
  - Measure ingestion performance with large datasets from each platform.
  - Ensure system stability under concurrent ingestion jobs.
- **Rate Limit Management**
  - Validate API rate limit adherence for each source integration.
  - Check for exponential backoff or throttling mechanisms.
