## 1. Introduction

This test plan outlines the strategy for validating the **Surveilr** platform’s **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** and **data ingestion subsystems**.  
Testing focuses on verifying reliability, correctness, and robustness of command executions, data ingestion pipelines, structured/unstructured file processing, web-based content, multimedia files, and external platform synchronizations.

**Objectives include:**  
- Ensuring CLI commands execute correctly and return accurate exit codes across **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.  
- Validating ingestion and parsing of diverse file formats (CSV, JSON, XML, DOCX, PDF, TXT, etc.).  
- Testing archive extraction (ZIP, TAR.GZ) and Capturable Executable (CE) file processing.  
- Verifying IMAP email ingestion, attachment processing, and duplicate handling.  
- Validating **web-based content ingestion** (HTML, RSS feeds, Web APIs) with error handling and metadata extraction.  
- Validating **multimedia file ingestion** (JPEG, PNG, MP3, MP4) with performance and metadata checks.  
- Confirming synchronization accuracy with third-party task platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Xray, Azure, AWS, GCP).  
- Ensuring consistent logging, error reporting, and traceability across all workflows.

## 2. Scope of Work

### In-Scope Activities
- **Functional Testing:**  
  Validate CLI commands, parameter handling, output responses, and error management on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.  

- **Data Ingestion Validation:**  
  Confirm ingestion of structured (CSV, JSON, XML, YAML) and unstructured (DOCX, PDF, TXT) files.  
  Test archive extraction (ZIP, TAR.GZ) and Capturable Executable (CE) file ingestion.  

- **IMAP Email Workflow Testing:**  
  Validate secure email retrieval, metadata parsing, and attachment ingestion.  

- **Web-Based Content Ingestion:**  
  Validate ingestion of HTML pages, RSS feeds, and Web APIs.  
  Test retry logic, error handling for invalid/unreachable sources, and metadata indexing.  

- **Multimedia File Ingestion:**  
  Validate ingestion and processing of JPEG, PNG, MP3, MP4 files.  
  Verify metadata extraction, system performance, and resilience against corrupt or oversized files.  

- **Third-Party Synchronization:**  
  Test task synchronization and mapping from GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Xray, Azure, AWS, and GCP.  
  Verify data consistency and reporting.  

- **Logging and Error Handling:**  
  Ensure complete, traceable logs for success/failure scenarios.  
  Validate error messages are meaningful and system remains stable under failure conditions.  

### Out of Scope
- Performance, stress, and scalability testing beyond ingestion of bulk datasets.  
- Security penetration or vulnerability assessment.  
- SLA validation for external third-party services.

## 3. Test Objectives

- Verify correctness and reliability of CLI commands and ingestion pipelines across **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.  
- Confirm data integrity during ingestion, parsing, transformation, and synchronization.  
- Validate system responses to malformed, missing, or corrupted files.  
- Ensure web and multimedia ingestion workflows handle errors gracefully.  
- Validate all test outcomes are logged, traceable, and reproducible.

## 4. Test Approach

### 4.1 Functional Testing
- Validate CLI command syntax, parameters, and output messages on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.  
- Execute functional flows covering ingestion, parsing, and logging validation.  
- Use **Playwright (TypeScript)** for automation and regression testing.  
- Ensure proper exception handling for invalid inputs or command misuse.  

### 4.2 Data Ingestion Testing
- Upload and validate diverse structured/unstructured file formats and archives.  
- Confirm accurate extraction, parsing, and metadata capture.  
- Test bulk ingestion and indexing consistency.  

### 4.3 IMAP Email Processing
- Validate successful connection, email fetching, and attachment ingestion.  
- Ensure duplicate handling, polling intervals, and failure recovery.  

### 4.4 Web-Based Content Testing
- Validate ingestion of HTML pages, RSS feeds, and API endpoints.  
- Test error handling, retries, and metadata extraction.  
- Confirm indexing and content storage correctness.  

### 4.5 Multimedia File Testing
- Validate ingestion and metadata extraction for JPEG, PNG, MP3, MP4 files.  
- Assess performance under bulk uploads.  
- Ensure error handling for corrupt or oversized files.  

### 4.6 Third-Party Integration Testing
- Connect Surveilr to test accounts for GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Xray, Azure, AWS, GCP.  
- Trigger synchronization and verify data mapping and consistency.  

### 4.7 Logging and Error Handling
- Review CLI and ingestion logs for completeness and accuracy.  
- Validate error messages are descriptive and aligned with standards.  
- Ensure logs capture command context, timestamps, and traceability.
