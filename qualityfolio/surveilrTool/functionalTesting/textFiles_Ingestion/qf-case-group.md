## Overview

The **Text File Handling** group ensures that Surveilr can correctly process text-based files used for documentation, logs, or content exports.  
These test cases validate that files can be ingested, parsed, and analyzed without data loss or formatting errors, while maintaining proper logging and analytics tracking.

## Key Functional Areas

### ðŸ”¹ Plain Text (.txt)
- Ensure plain text files are ingested without loss of content.  
- Validate handling of newlines, special characters, and encoding variations.  
- Confirm accurate parsing of numeric, string, and date content where applicable.  
- Verify error handling for empty or malformed text files.  

### ðŸ”¹ Markdown (.md)
- Ensure Markdown files retain formatting for headings, lists, code blocks, and tables.  
- Validate correct parsing of inline links, images, and special Markdown syntax.  
- Confirm proper extraction of metadata (front matter) if present.  
- Verify errors are logged for corrupted or invalid Markdown files.  

### ðŸ”¹ Rich Text (.rtf)
- Ensure RTF files are parsed correctly, including text formatting (bold, italic, underline).  
- Validate handling of embedded objects, tables, and images.  
- Confirm Surveilr detects and logs unsupported elements gracefully.  
- Test error handling for corrupted or partially formatted RTF files.  

### ðŸ”¹ General File Handling
- Accept only supported text file extensions (.txt, .md, .rtf).  
- Ensure proper error messages for unsupported file types.  
- Validate system performance when processing large text files.  
- Confirm accurate storage, retrieval, and accessibility for reporting or further analysis.
