### Test Steps
1. Prepare an RTF file containing embedded objects like charts or OLE elements.  
2. Upload the file via Surveilr.  
3. Open and render the file.  
4. Observe handling of embedded objects.

### Expected Result

- Unsupported objects are detected and logged gracefully without crashing.
