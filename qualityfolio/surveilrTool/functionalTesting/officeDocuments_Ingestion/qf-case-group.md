## Key Functional Areas

### ðŸ”¹ File Upload & Validation
- **Supported File Types**  
  - Validate upload support for Word (.doc, .docx), Excel (.xls, .xlsx), PowerPoint (.ppt, .pptx), and PDF (.pdf).  
  - Ensure unsupported file types trigger proper error messages.  
- **Corrupted Files**  
  - Verify system response to corrupted or partially uploaded documents.  
  - Ensure no crash or unhandled exceptions occur.  
- **File Size Restrictions**  
  - Test upper boundary limits for document uploads.  
  - Ensure error messages display correctly for oversized files.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ File Preview & Rendering
- **Document Rendering**  
  - Confirm that uploaded documents display correctly in the Surveilr viewer.  
  - Check for formatting consistency (fonts, alignment, charts, and embedded media).  
- **Content Integrity**  
  - Ensure no data loss or truncation during preview.  
  - Validate multi-page navigation for PDFs and PowerPoints.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Metadata & Version Control
- **Metadata Management**  
  - Validate edit and update operations for title, tags, and description fields.  
  - Ensure changes persist and reflect immediately in file listings.  
- **Version History**  
  - Verify uploading a newer version preserves prior versions.  
  - Confirm rollback or version comparison works correctly.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Download, Delete & Security
- **File Download**  
  - Verify download functionality for all supported file types.  
  - Ensure file integrity and original structure are retained.  
- **Delete Operations**  
  - Validate proper deletion of uploaded documents.  
  - Confirm removal from the system index and search results.  
- **Access Control**  
  - Ensure file-level permission checks (read, write, delete).  
  - Validate unauthorized users cannot view or modify restricted documents.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Validate keyboard navigation and accessibility attributes for all file interaction components.  
- Confirm screen readers properly announce file states and actions (upload success, preview active, etc.).  
- Verify responsive layout behavior for document management modules across desktop, tablet, and mobile.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Error Handling & Performance
- **Error Feedback**  
  - Ensure clear and descriptive error messages for all failure states (invalid format, timeout, permission denied).  
- **Performance**  
  - Assess file upload and preview response times under normal and heavy loads.  
  - Validate system stability with concurrent file operations.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Compliance & Logging
- **Audit Logging**  
  - Verify all file actions (upload, edit, delete) are logged with timestamps and user details.  
- **Compliance Validation**  
  - Ensure compliance with organizational data retention and file management policies.
