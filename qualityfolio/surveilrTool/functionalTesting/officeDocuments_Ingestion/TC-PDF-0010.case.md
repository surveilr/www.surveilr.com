### Description
Assess Surveilrâ€™s ability to handle large PDF uploads (e.g., 100+ pages or >100MB) without performance degradation.

### Test Steps
1. Upload a large multi-page PDF file (>100MB).  
2. Observe system response time during upload and parsing.  
3. Verify stability and responsiveness post-upload.  

### Expected Result
- Upload completes within acceptable performance limits.  
- No timeout or system freeze occurs.  
- Metadata extraction and preview generation succeed for large files.
