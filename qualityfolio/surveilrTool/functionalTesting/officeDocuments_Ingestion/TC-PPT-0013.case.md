### Description
Validate Surveilrâ€™s ability to process PowerPoint files with multiple slides and embedded media (images, charts, videos).

### Test Steps
1. Upload a `.pptx` file containing 10+ slides with embedded content.  
2. Wait for the parsing process to complete.  
3. Review extracted metadata and content preview.  

### Expected Result
- All slides are detected correctly.  
- Embedded media does not cause parsing or display issues.  
- Metadata shows slide count and embedded object presence.
