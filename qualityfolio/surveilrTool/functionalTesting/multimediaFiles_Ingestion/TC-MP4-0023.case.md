### Description
- Validate system handling when uploading MP4 files with unsupported video codecs.

### Test Steps
1. Prepare an MP4 file encoded with an unsupported codec (e.g., H.265 if not supported).  
2. Upload the file to Surveiler.  
3. Monitor system processing behavior.

### Expected Result
- System converts the video to a supported codec or shows a warning.  
- No crash or ingestion failure occurs.
