### Description
- Validate upload resilience and retry mechanisms when the network is unstable during MP4 upload.

### Test Steps
1. Begin uploading an MP4 file while simulating intermittent network connectivity.  
2. Observe retry logic and UI feedback.  
3. Review system logs for upload handling and error capture.

### Expected Result
- Partial uploads are handled gracefully.  
- Retry occurs automatically, or a clear error message is shown.
