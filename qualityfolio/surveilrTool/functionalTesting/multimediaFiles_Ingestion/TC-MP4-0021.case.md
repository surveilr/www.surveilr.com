- Validate system stability and logging when a corrupted MP4 file is uploaded.

### Test Steps
1. Create or obtain a corrupted MP4 file (broken headers, missing frames).

3. Monitor logs and observe ingestion behavior.

### Expected Result
- Ingestion fails gracefully without crashing.  
- Error details are logged clearly for debugging.
