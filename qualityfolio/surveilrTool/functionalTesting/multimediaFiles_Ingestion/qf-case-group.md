## Overview

This test case group defines a comprehensive set of test cases to validate the **multimedia ingestion functionality** of the Surveiler application.  
It ensures that JPEG, PNG, MP3, and MP4 files are uploaded, processed, and displayed correctly while maintaining performance, metadata accuracy, and system stability under various conditions.

## Key Functional Areas

### ðŸ”¹ File Ingestion Workflow
- **Upload Functionality**  
  - Validate successful ingestion of supported formats (JPEG, PNG, MP3, MP4).  
  - Verify file size limits and ensure proper error messages for oversized files.  
  - Confirm system behavior for corrupted, incomplete, or malformed files.  
  - Test batch uploads to evaluate performance and handling of multiple concurrent files.  

- **Metadata Extraction & Storage**  
  - Ensure metadata (resolution, bitrate, duration, etc.) is correctly extracted and stored.  
  - Validate handling of missing metadata â€” default system values should be assigned.  
  - Confirm proper tagging and indexing for efficient search and retrieval.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Validation Scenarios
- **Happy Path (Valid Files)**  
  - Supported multimedia files (JPEG, PNG, MP3, MP4) upload and display successfully.  
  - Verify playback, preview, or thumbnail generation works as expected.  

- **Unhappy Path (Invalid/Unsupported Conditions)**  
  - Files exceeding limits or using unsupported formats show descriptive errors.  
  - Missing or incorrect metadata handled gracefully with default values or warnings.  

- **Miserable Path (System Stress & Failures)**  
  - Corrupted or extremely large files should not crash the system.  
  - Network interruptions during uploads should trigger retry or proper error handling.  
  - Validate system logs for ingestion failures and confirm stability post-failure.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Ensure that upload buttons, progress indicators, and error messages are accessible via keyboard navigation.  
- Screen reader support for upload status and completion messages.  
- Validate layout and responsiveness of the upload interface across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Performance & Logging
- Measure ingestion time for large and batch uploads.  
- Verify system resource utilization (CPU, memory) remains within acceptable limits.  
- Confirm all ingestion actions (success/failure) are logged with timestamps and user references.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Security & Compliance
- Ensure only authenticated users can upload files.  
- Validate input sanitization and prevention of malicious file uploads.  
- Confirm compliance with organizational data retention and deletion policies.
