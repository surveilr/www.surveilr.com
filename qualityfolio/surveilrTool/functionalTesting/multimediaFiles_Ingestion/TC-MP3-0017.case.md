### Description
- Validate file upload handling when MP3 filenames contain special characters.

### Test Steps
1. Prepare a valid MP3 file named with special characters (e.g., `song@#$.mp3`).  
2. Upload it through the Surveiler interface.  
3. Verify ingestion, playback, and filename display.

### Expected Result
- File is ingested successfully without filename-related issues.  
- Special characters are preserved properly in the system.
