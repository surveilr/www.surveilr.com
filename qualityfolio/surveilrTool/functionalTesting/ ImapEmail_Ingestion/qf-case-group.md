## Overview

This test case group defines a collection of related test cases designed to validate the **IMAP email ingestion and processing workflow** within the **Surveilr** platform.  
It ensures coverage of IMAP connectivity, authentication handling, email retrieval, attachment classification, error resilience, and overall ingestion performance.

## Key Functional Areas

### ðŸ”¹ Connectivity & Authentication
- **IMAP Server Connection**  
  - Validate successful connection to IMAP server using valid credentials.  
  - Handle invalid credentials, permission issues, and unreachable server scenarios.  

- **Authentication Handling**  
  - Confirm correct login sequence for IMAP sessions.  
  - Verify retry attempts, timeout handling, and secure session termination.  
---

### ðŸ”¹ Email Retrieval & Metadata Extraction
- **Email Fetching**  
  - Retrieve single and multiple emails from IMAP inbox or subfolders.  
  - Handle empty mailboxes and large mailbox scenarios efficiently.  

- **Metadata Extraction**  
  - Validate extraction of email headers (Subject, Sender, Timestamp).  
  - Confirm mapping accuracy between source metadata and Surveilrâ€™s task model.  
---

### ðŸ”¹ Attachment & Content Handling
- **Attachment Classification**  
  - Validate correct attachment categorization (PDF â†’ Document, CSV â†’ Structured Data, Images â†’ Media Files).  
  - Ensure unsupported formats are skipped with proper log entries.  

- **Body & Storage**  
  - Confirm body text and attachments are stored correctly in designated folders.  
  - Verify folder structure and space limit handling for IMAP data.  
---

### ðŸ”¹ Error Handling & Duplication Prevention
- **Corrupted & Unsupported Emails**  
  - Skip malformed or unreadable emails while processing valid ones.  
  - Log proper error messages with timestamps.  

- **Duplicate Detection**  
  - Prevent re-ingestion of previously processed emails.  
  - Log warning for duplicates without overwriting existing tasks.  
---

### ðŸ”¹ Performance & Reliability
- Validate ingestion throughput under high-volume email loads.  
- Confirm Surveilr stability during concurrent IMAP account processing.  
- Monitor connection retries and response times during simulated outages.
