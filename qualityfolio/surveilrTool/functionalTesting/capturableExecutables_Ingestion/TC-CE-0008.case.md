### Description
- Test Surveiler behavior when concurrent CE ingestion causes deadlock.

### Test Steps
1. Simultaneously upload multiple CE files.  
2. Trigger ingestion for all files at the same time.  
3. Monitor system for hangs or deadlocks.  
4. Inspect task queue and logs.

### Expected Result
- System hangs and no tasks are ingested until restart.  
- Logs indicate deadlock situation.  
- System recovery required to resume ingestion.
