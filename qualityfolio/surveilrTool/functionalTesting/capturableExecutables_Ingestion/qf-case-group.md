## Overview

This test case group defines a collection of test cases designed to validate the ingestion workflow of **Capturable Executable (CE) files** within Surveiler.  
It ensures proper ingestion of tasks, correct handling of corrupted or duplicate files, system stability under high load, and data integrity after ingestion.

## Key Functional Areas

### ðŸ”¹ Happy Path Ingestion
- **Successful CE Ingestion**
  - Verify tasks from a valid CE file are ingested correctly.
  - Confirm tasks appear in the queue with correct metadata.
- **Partial CE Ingestion**
  - Validate multiple tasks in a CE file are ingested successfully.
  - Ensure status reflects successful ingestion for all tasks.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Error Handling & Validation
- **Corrupted CE File**
  - Check that corrupted or incomplete CE files are not ingested.
  - Ensure system logs the error and user is notified.
- **Invalid CE Format**
  - Validate that CE files with incorrect schema are rejected.
  - Confirm proper error message is displayed.
- **Duplicate Tasks**
  - Ensure previously ingested tasks are ignored or flagged.
  - Verify new tasks continue ingestion without errors.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Miserable / Critical Scenarios
- **System Crash During Ingestion**
  - Test ingestion of large CE files causing high load.
  - Confirm system handles failure gracefully or alerts administrators.
- **Data Corruption After Ingestion**
  - Verify that tasks ingested correctly maintain data integrity.
  - Check alerts are triggered if fields are corrupted.
- **Deadlock / Concurrency Issues**
  - Validate system behavior when multiple CE files are ingested simultaneously.
  - Confirm system does not hang indefinitely and proper recovery mechanisms exist.
