### Description
- Validate Surveilrâ€™s performance and stability when processing a large CSV file (>100,000 rows).

### Test Steps
1. Generate a large CSV file with 100,000+ records.  
2. Run `surveilr ingest files --input large_dataset.csv`.  
3. Measure total ingestion time and monitor logs for memory or timeout errors.  

### Expected Result
- Ingestion completes successfully without memory overflow.  
- Exit code = `0`.  
- Execution time within acceptable performance threshold.
