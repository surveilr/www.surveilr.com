## Overview

The **Data File and Archive Handling** group ensures that Surveilr can correctly handle structured data files and archive files used for configuration, logs, tabular data, or bulk uploads.  
These test cases validate that files and archives can be ingested, parsed, extracted, and analyzed without data loss or errors, while maintaining proper logging, analytics integration, and system stability.

## Key Functional Areas

### ðŸ”¹ CSV (.csv) â€“ Comma-Separated Values
- Ensure CSV files with headers and multiple rows are parsed correctly.  
- Validate proper handling of commas, quotes, and escape characters.  
- Confirm numeric, string, and date values are interpreted accurately.  
- Verify error handling for malformed, empty, or inconsistent CSV files.  

### ðŸ”¹ JSON (.json) â€“ Structured Objects, Configurations, and Logs
- Ensure JSON files are parsed into correct key-value structures.  
- Validate nested objects and arrays are handled accurately.  
- Confirm Surveilr gracefully handles missing or invalid fields.  
- Verify proper logging for corrupted or malformed JSON files.  

### ðŸ”¹ YAML / YML (.yaml, .yml) â€“ Configuration Files
- Ensure YAML files load correctly, including nested maps and sequences.  
- Validate handling of anchors, aliases, and multi-line strings.  
- Confirm proper error messages for invalid indentation or syntax.  
- Test parsing of multiple YAML documents within a single file.  

### ðŸ”¹ XML (.xml) â€“ Structured Markup Data
- Ensure XML files with nested elements and attributes are parsed correctly.  
- Validate handling of namespaces, CDATA sections, and special characters.  
- Confirm errors are raised for malformed XML or missing closing tags.  
- Test integration with Surveilr analytics for structured data extraction.  

### ðŸ”¹ ZIP / Archive (.zip, .tar.gz) â€“ Compressed and Bulk File Handling
- Ensure **local uploads** of ZIP and TAR.GZ archives are processed correctly.  
- Validate **recursive extraction** of nested archives.  
- Confirm proper **file type recognition** for extracted files (CSV, JSON, YAML, XML, unknown).  
- Test handling of **corrupted archives**, **empty archives**, and **archives with invalid or nested filenames**.  
- Validate **large archive stress testing** with hundreds or thousands of files.  

### ðŸ”¹ General File Handling
- Accept only supported file extensions (.csv, .json, .yaml, .yml, .xml, .zip, .tar.gz).  
- Ensure proper error messages for unsupported file types.  
- Confirm accurate storage, retrieval, and accessibility for reporting or further analysis.
