## Overview

This test case group defines a collection of related test cases designed to validate **web-based content ingestion** within Surveilr.  
It ensures coverage of critical ingestion workflows, handling of structured and unstructured web content, proper error handling for edge cases, and robustness against network or malformed data scenarios.

## Key Functional Areas

### ðŸ”¹ HTML Page Ingestion
- **Valid HTML Pages**
  - Ensure standard HTML pages are ingested and parsed correctly.  
  - Validate content, images, tables, and metadata are stored.  

- **Edge/Invalid HTML**
  - Test HTML with missing `<body>` or broken tags.  
  - Verify empty HTML pages are rejected.  
  - Handle HTML containing malicious scripts safely.  

- **Large HTML Pages**
  - Verify ingestion for large files (>5MB) without timeout or crash.

---

### ðŸ”¹ RSS Feed Ingestion
- **Valid RSS Feeds**
  - Ensure standard RSS feeds with multiple items are ingested correctly.  
  - Validate feed metadata (title, link, date) captured accurately.  

- **Invalid or Empty Feeds**
  - Handle RSS feeds with malformed XML or missing `<item>` entries.  
  - Verify empty feeds fail gracefully with appropriate logs.  

- **Unreachable / Timeout Feeds**
  - Test RSS feed URLs that are unreachable or slow.  
  - Ensure ingestion fails gracefully and logs errors.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Web API Ingestion
- **Valid API Responses**
  - Ensure APIs returning JSON/XML are ingested completely.  
  - Validate multiple records are handled correctly.  

- **Invalid or Empty API Data**
  - Handle malformed JSON/XML responses.  
  - Ensure empty responses are logged and fail gracefully.  

- **Error & Authorization Handling**
  - Verify behavior for unauthorized (401) or forbidden (403) responses.  
  - Test network timeouts and unreachable API endpoints.  
  - Ensure system logs issues without crashing and continues other ingestion.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Accessibility & Robustness
- Validate that ingestion processes handle errors gracefully.  
- Ensure logs provide clear messages for failures or warnings.  
- Confirm ingestion pipeline remains stable under high load or invalid inputs.
