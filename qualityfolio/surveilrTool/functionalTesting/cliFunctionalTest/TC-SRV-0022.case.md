### Description

- Check CLI behavior when log directory permissions prevent writing logs.

### Preconditions

- CLI installed.  
- Log directory permissions restricted.

### Test Steps

1. Open terminal.  
2. Restrict write permissions on log directory.  
3. Run any CLI command.  
4. Observe CLI behavior and logs (if any).  
5. Close terminal.

### Expected Result

- CLI gracefully reports logging failure without crashing.  
- System logs indicate inability to write logs.
