## Overview

The **Functional CLI Testing** group ensures that Surveilr's command-line interface behaves as expected.  
These test cases validate **command execution**, proper handling of **parameters and flags**, accurate **exit codes**, and reliable **logging** for both success and failure scenarios.

## Key Functional Areas

### ðŸ”¹ Core CLI Commands
- Validate execution of all critical commands.  
- Ensure commands run successfully with expected outcomes.  
- Confirm error handling for invalid or unsupported commands.  

### ðŸ”¹ Parameter & Flag Handling
- Verify correct parsing of CLI parameters and flags.  
- Test optional and mandatory flags for all commands.  
- Validate behavior when invalid or unsupported options are provided.  

### ðŸ”¹ Exit Codes
- Confirm that commands return standard exit codes for success and failure.  
- Test proper exit codes for error scenarios, including missing files, invalid formats, or failed operations.  
- Ensure automation scripts can reliably detect command outcomes based on exit codes.  

### ðŸ”¹ Log Outputs
- Verify that logs are generated for each command execution.  
- Confirm logs capture errors, warnings, and success messages.  
- Validate consistency of log formats for automated monitoring, debugging, or auditing.
